{"id": "63c1ad1e-ce40-4975-80c9-b78328171b4e", "method": "storium", "score": 85, "explanation": "The script presents a unique blend of a vigilante justice scenario with a structured game-like approach to storytelling, incorporating specific mechanics and challenges that guide the narrative. While the theme of vigilantes confronting a villain is not uncommon, the methodical and game-oriented structure, combined with the moral dilemma of choosing between extrajudicial execution and legal justice, is less frequently encountered in scripts. The inclusion of a detailed character generation process and the focus on investigation as a key element also adds to the distinctiveness of this script."}
