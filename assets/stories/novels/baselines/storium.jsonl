Right now, good ol' \"City of Angels\" is a fuckin' mess.*\n\n*Name's Jack, kid, and lucky for you, I've got a few minutes to bring you up to speed. Don't know how much you pay attention to politics and the like, but LA is a free state. No Prince, no Camarilla sticking their noses in everyone's business. Live and let live is the motto. Heh, as much as any of us get any living done, anyways.*\n\n*Problem is, while the area's been stable for a while, in a city full of predators - Kindred and Kine alike - things never stay quiet for long.*\n\n*There's been a string of killings. All Kine deaths, so far, so none of the local big shots have wanted to get involved. Real problem is, they're getting more and more brutal, and some folk are worried that the killer might be a rogue Kindred, or worse. Long story short, there ain't too many of us what aren't under suspicion these days, yours truly included. Sure there's no official Camarilla presence here, but don't be fooled, they have eyes and ears in more places than I'd care to know, and if they're not watching you can bet one of the local barons or somesuch is on your tail.*\n\n*I wouldn't blame you if you got the hell outta dodge while you still can, but seeing as how you're one of the few suckers who's not really a suspect, maybe you could look into this. You got an edge here: until somebody throws the blame your way, you might be able to get somewhere other folks ain't been able to. Worth a shot if we can finally figure out what the hell is going on in this damn city.*\n\n*Whaddaya say, kid? Up for a little action?*\n\n***\n\nSince before recorded history, humans have walked alongside the creatures of the night. Vampires, or Kindred, in their own words, are perhaps chief among such nocturnal terrors. For centuries, those embraced by eternal death have walked among their mortal kine, hidden from human knowledge by all manner of deceptions.\n\nThe Masquerade, they call it - the set of rules by which Kindred hide themselves from their prey. Though there has been no official Masquerade in Anarch-controlled LA for some time, even the more foolish of the Kindred adhere to some kind of code. There is no benefit in being seen for what they are, and humans are numerous enough that they could overpower all but perhaps the strongest of Vampires, given the knowledge of their existence.\n\nStill, some Kindred choose to make displays of their power, rather than abide the deceptions of their kin. In Camarilla-controlled areas, these dissenters are most often hunted and destroyed by the Camarilla's powerful law-keepers. In Anarch baronies, there are no official enforcers of the Masquerade, but its importance is recognized and those who refuse to abide are often chased out or meet an 'unfortunate' end to their eternity.\n\nNow, in the barony of Los Angeles, a string of near-supernatural killings is becoming worse - and more bizarre - by the night. While it's not clear yet that a Vampire, or any other supernatural being, is to blame, it has become evident that whoever is responsible is likely not human.\n\nWhatever the reason, you have managed to avoid suspicion, for now at least. What is a nuisance for most could be an opportunity for you. Should you bring the killer to justice, or simply keep him from threatening the Masquerade, you may make for yourself powerful allies among the Kindred. Whatever your aspirations, political or otherwise, having powerful friends can always be useful, especially when you have eternity to use them. Be careful though - you can make enemies far more easily than allies.\n\nOh, and try to stay out of the sun.\n\n", "story": "Name: Shadows of the City\n\nOutline: The first chapter will introduce the protagonist, a newly embraced vampire in the Anarch-controlled barony of Los Angeles.

{"id": "1a48dc32-dbac-4af7-a71c-eab15c22fb41", "premise": "The year is 2070 AD. Since the early 2020s, the world has been changed by the appearance of individuals with abilities beyond those of normal humans. People with command over fire and ice, people with the power to read and control minds, people who flew through the air and shrugged off gunfire. Individuals with a seemingly endless variety of powers appeared in greater and greater numbers all across the world.\n\nSome of these people were the products of science, either granted powers by accident or through intentional human experimentation. Others were simply born with their abilities with no obvious explanation. Scientists continue to debate the source of these abilities, with no clear consensus having yet been reached.\n\nWhatever the source of these superpowered individuals, it was only a tragically short amount of time before many of them turned to crime. So-called 'supervillainy' became a worldwide epidemic as non-powered law enforcement proved helpless to stop this new breed of criminal.\n\nFortunately, just as many powered individuals proved willing to step up and defend their communities against this menace. Vigilantes took to the streets in costumes and masks, fighting against criminals that law enforcement was unable to stop. While these individuals were highly controversial at first, governments worldwide began to realize that powered crime fighters were the only ones capable of protecting the public in this new age.\n\nThus began the careers of the first superheroes. Government agencies began to offer official sponsorship to certain heroes who had proven themselves as defenders of their communities. Teams of powered individuals increasingly replaced mundane law enforcement in cities across the globe. Most major urban centers now have at least one officially recognized team of heroes tasked with defending the people against all manner of villainy. Many of them still wear costumes like the vigilantes of old out of respect for tradition.\n\nOf course, not all 'heroes' have taken on the role of a crime fighter out of a selfless desire to do good. Powered individuals are still in short supply, and government agencies will pay handsomely to get the best of the best on their side. Corporations increasingly offer sponsorship to superhero teams, placing their logos on their costumes and equipment in exchange for large cash contributions. Superheroes feature prominently in many major national advertising campaigns. Some of the most prominent heroes are among the most wealthy and famous people alive today. This includes the Justice Squad, the famed protectors of Champion City, a metropolis on the east coast of the United States\n\nYou aren't one of those heroes. You have no corporate sponsors. You have no government contract. You are what many might call a 'C-list hero'. You probably have a day job of some sort, and might just be scraping by to make ends meet. Still, the Justice Squad can't be everywhere in Champion City. You might just be doing what you can to stop petty street crime for now, but who knows? The opportunity to make it into the big leagues might be right around the corner.\n\nOOC INFORMATION:\n\nI'm aiming to tell a sort of 'classic' superhero story here. It won't be a hundred percent dark and gritty, but it won't be entirely comedic or silly either. Think Batman: The Animated Series as an example of the sort of tone here. There will be plenty of action scenes battling supervillains and other criminals, but there will also be non-action based scenes dealing with the other difficulties of life as a superhero.\n\nFeel free to draw from classic superhero tropes. Capes, masks, and silly costumes are fine. Backstories can range from tragic to mildly ridiculous. Secret identities are common in the setting, and you can feel free to have both a 'hero name' and a regular name.\n\nYou are welcome to use either the provided cards for natures, strengths, weaknesses, and subplots, or to create your own custom cards. Feel free to add art.\n\nAll characters will start as unaffiliated 'C-list' heroes who are unconnected with an established team or organization. They will be given a reason to start working together fairly quickly in the first scene.\n\nPlease include some description of your character's powers and abilities in your application, along with a brief origin story to explain how they got them.\n\nI will be looking for a group of 3-6 players. This is a reboot of a story which ran last year. Feel free to look it up if you'd like, but it may spoil plot points from some early scenes.", "story": "Name: Rise of the C-List Heroes\n\nOutline: The first chapter will introduce the world where superpowered individuals have become both heroes and villains.

We are glad to have you on board for the 1995 season and hope you\u2019ll make many happy memories of your own in the process of providing excellent service for our park\u2019s many visitors.\n\nYour official start date is Thursday, May 25, one week before the park opens for guests. Please bring the enclosed health forms and housing survey when you report for orientation. Please also bring a swimsuit. We have a new water slide this year and will be counting on you to help test it out!\n\nIf you have questions in the meantime, please contact me at 814-555-0944.\n\nSee you in May!\n\nBrad Summers\n\nStaff Coordinator\n\nSummerland Adventure Park\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nSummerland was founded in the late 1960\u2019s by the late Gerald Summers, a billionaire hoping to recreate some of the magic of his childhood summers visiting Coney Island.  He felt that Disney and the other mega-parks were too corporate, too profit-driven. He wanted a place for families to make memories that went beyond the merchandizing.\n\nThe park is nestled in the hills of rural Pennsylvania and features several water rides, a wooden roller coaster, an theater for outdoor concerts, and the usual odds and ends of boardwalk games and other family attractions.  There\u2019s also a restaurant on site with a beer garden.\n\nBecause the park is in a remote area, on-site housing is available for employees of your level.  While this perk was originally intended as a money-saver for younger employees, it added a fun dimension to the work experience.  Some have described it as having a \u201csummer camp\u201d sort of feeling, which Summers fostered by hosting parties and special events throughout the season for all the employees.\n\nAnd now your Summerland adventures await!  You've gotten one of the coveted spots on the staff for the 1995 season.  Let's make it a summer to remember.\n\n========================================\n\nOOC Goodies:\n\nI envision Summerland as a fun, summer romance story. I\u2019d like for this to be a character-driven narrative, exploring relationships and the sorts of situations people get into when away from their \u201creal lives\u201d for the summer, meeting new people, and possibly reinventing or discovering themselves.\n\nAll player characters will be 20-somethings who have applied for jobs at the park.  Please feel free to make your own cards if you think of something that interests you more.  I don't mind a lot of duplication with the nature cards (you can all be college students, if you like), but I'd love to see some diversity with the other cards.\n\nAlthough I anticipate player characters pairing off, I\u2019ll have some NPC\u2019s for you to interact with (and pair with) depending on your character\u2019s interests.  I haven't planned a rigid structure, though I have some goals and events in mind to help add structure. I\u2019m open to suggestions on all these things as the story develops, too.  \n\nI\u2019ve set the story in the 1990\u2019s, so if you guys want to have fun with all the trends from that to add some flavor, go for it.  No historical accuracy is necessary.  The park is in a fairly remote, so it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019d be watching the news anyway.\n\nGiven the number of characters involved, I've marked this as slow, but please try to move every 3 days or so, minimally. (More is fine, of course!) If you need time away, just mention it in the comments.  If you're gone for more than a week without saying something, we'll write you out.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a first-time narrator, so I welcome feedback on my work here, as well.  :)", "story": "Name: Summerland Adventures\n\nOutline:\n\n- Introduce the main character, a college student named Alex, as they arrive at Summerland Adventure Park for the start of the 1995 season.\n\n- Describe the excitement and nervousness of the new job, as well as the anticipation of meeting new people and experiencing the adventures of the summer.\n\n- Set the scene of the park, its attractions, and the housing area where the employees will be staying.\n\nAlex stood at the entrance of Summerland Adventure Park, taking in the sight of the wooden roller coaster and the colorful water slides.

Once the beating heart of the Rosdin Robotics Corporation, Tear now lies abandoned in the wake of a deadly plague which forced the city's inhabitants to seek shelter in the chaos and lawlessness of post-democratic America. But although humanity has deserted Tear, the city is far from dead: for, in the wake of disaster, Rosdin's world-famous robotics survives.\n\nFollowing the Great Market Fallout, Tear was built to be the world's first self-sustaining city, complete with underground farming facilities, fully-automated recycling depots, and rehabilitation centres for criminals, madmen, and defective robots. The megacorp's secret weapon to realize this? The Empathy Matrix - a precise blend of programming and circuitry which allows for sentient thought patterns and emotion in robots. An Empathy Matrix can be found in every Rosdin robot, and it is by way of these deceptively simple chips that Rosdin obliterated rival companies Shigu Enterprises and Taylen Corp. Though Empathy Matrices do not allow for exact duplication of sapient thought, everyone in America knows that Rosdin's automatons are not mere machines; they are true Artificial Intellects.\n\nNow, with the loss of their greatest achievement, the Rosdin Corporation is in shambles. But you - poor, lost soul, you - do not know of this. Nor do you care.\n\nFor something is awakening the robots within Tear. Something subtle. Something that will shake the foundations of the world for years to come.\n\nAnd you are its next target.\n\n==========================================\n\nIn this campaign, players will take the identities of various robots within the abandoned city of Tear. Your characters will be, in essence, human, save for their lack of inner organs, flesh, nerves, etc.; take this into account when you act, as it's unlikely your character will feel pain (though warning sensors will likely activate) or emotions akin to a human's.\n\nYou'll begin in a factory somewhere in Tear as the newest recipients of the Awakening Virus - a strange disease which changes the programming of robots' Empathy Matrices and fully activates their sapient programming. Though only Rosdin-built robots are created with Empathy Matrices, don't be afraid to choose a different manufacturer, so long as you can explain their presence within the city - perhaps as a research tool, perhaps as some mechanic's toy. Non-Rosdin AI can succumb to the Virus as well (more on this in-game).\n\nLooking for 4-5 players, preferably. I encourage you all to create your own Natures, Strengths, and Weaknesses. Flex that creativity! This'll be my first Narration, so bear with me. Thank you!", "story": "Name: Awakening Tear\n\nOutline: The first chapter will introduce the city of Tear, once a thriving hub for the Rosdin Robotics Corporation, now abandoned due to a deadly plague.

It cleared away the complexities of politics, proprietary knowledge, and patents to allow the free research of cutting edge science and technology, and undertook to train an elite fighting force for global response to alien threats that might arise. \n\nBut the aliens never came, and the research bore only limited fruit, much of which couldn\u2019t even be used in the world outside XCOM. The Council of Nations funding the project shrank, budget and resources dwindled, and the project soon became a convenient place to offload troublemakers, weirdos, and other inconvenient problems. Its staff became a skeleton crew, its core mission a joke, and its command assignment a career dead end. Only a handful of diehard advocates on the Council kept the project from being entirely scrapped and its assets sold off to the highest bidder.\n\nNow, of course, the aliens *are* here, and this idealistic, atrophied dream is the only force capable of immediate global response.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE FEB 20TH:** The war with the aliens continues, and pressure on XCOM personnel is only increasing. Now is the time to step up and join the effort to save humanity.\n\nWhile this story isn't actively recruiting, we welcome interested players and newcomers to Storium who are interested in a friendly space to explore characters under intense pressure. Just send a PM! \n\nDon\u2019t let the size of the cast or the existing story intimidate you, there\u2019s still plenty of room for more voices and perspectives, and no need to be intimately familiar with everything that's happened to date. XCOM maintains a public channel on the Unofficial Storium Slack for discussion and brainstorming. Feel free to say hi anytime you like.\n\nA high-level summary of the story so far is provided for convenient catch up and familiarization with the plot.\n\n---\n\n[Link to personnel roster(s)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yFuNIjTyxkDYLqs_Vk6u-kGjZ0RXSjYFHybcWH8hERY/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n---\n\n##The story so far...\n\n***In the month of March,*** the XCOM project was hastily activated in response to reports of aliens invading--not through a full scale assault, but with a concerted effort to abduct humans, making landings, and infiltrate infrastructure. While this shadow war continued, staff was hastily added to XCOM\u2019s base of operations in Brazil, and tensions mounted as the project struggled with budget constraints, secrecy, conflicting interests, and frayed nerves. \n\nUltimately, and despite the loss of one operative and injuries sustained by others, the XCOM project made great strides in beginning to harness alien technology and learning about alien physiology. Towards the end of the month, a bold plan was hatched: to truly understand the aliens, what they want, and how to defeat them, the XCOM project needed to bring one in alive.\n\n***In the month of April,*** the XCOM project made critical headway to its top priority: interrogating a living alien. Unfortunately, while XCOM solved the question of how to capture and hold an alien, attempts to capture one remain elusive. After two months of incredibly brutal missions, the roster is looking increasingly thin. Worse still, XCOM\u2019s management experiences a radical shake-up, as a new interim commander is put in place and a new Ops Chief imposed by the Council. With new initiatives and new operational patterns struggling to take hold, the project must continue to make headway against the alien threat.\n\nThe question hanging over XCOM\u2019s scientists and engineers centers around the new element, Elerium, the still-unknown substance Meld. and new aliens encountered in the field. Towards the end of the month, while the XCOM R&D division closes in on a breakthrough for improved field armor, the aliens abruptly change their tactics and start hitting urban populations in a campaign of terror. Finally unavoidable, XCOM is revealed to the public.\n\n***In the month of May,*** XCOM made many breakthroughs, both strategically and technologically. Now fielding prototype laser weaponry and alien alloy armor, XCOM succeeded in bringing in a live alien--and, later in the month, a *second* live alien, as well as a key piece of salvage from a landed alien craft. Unfortunately, public opinion continued to tumble after XCOM went public, as the organization is criticized for their response to threats, and for an especially bad incident in a small, Canadian fishing village. The appearance of a rogue organization, \u201cEXALT,\u201d resulted in even greater turmoil, this time extending to XCOM itself as EXALT proved they\u2019d infiltrated the Project, and turned key personnel against it. \n\nAs the month drew to a close, XCOM faced continually dwindling resources to protect the globe but wasn\u2019t ready to call it quits. They struck back at EXALT, neutralizing an aggressive cell in South Africa, and showed the Council their dramatic progress in facing the alien threat. But it wasn\u2019t quite enough. Facing increasing public pressure, France and Germany withdrew from the Council.\n\n\n---\n\n##Table of Contents\n\n* **[Scene 1-1: March 1st, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-1/scene-1)**, wherein the project is activated and operatives return from their first active mission in nearby Sao Paulo.\n* **[Scene 1-2: March 8th, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-1/scene-2)**.

The path ahead seemed fraught with danger and uncertainty, but the protagonist knew that they had to find the strength within themselves to confront their fears and continue the journey, no matter the outcome.\n\nThe protagonist's determination led them to pursue the rumors of an ancient artifact that was said to hold the key to fulfilling the prophecy. As they delved deeper into their quest, they encountered challenges that tested their principles and pushed the limits of their determination. The price of obtaining the artifact was not just a physical one, but a moral and emotional one as well. The protagonist struggled with the decision, torn between the greater good and the sacrifices that would be required.

The journey had become more than just a quest for the salvation of the land; it had become a journey of self-discovery, a search for the inner strength and courage needed to face the challenges ahead.\n\nThe protagonist's pursuit of the ancient artifact led them to a hidden temple, nestled deep within the heart of the Forbidden Forest. As they ventured into the dense foliage, the air grew thick with an otherworldly silence, broken only by the rustling of leaves and the distant calls of unknown creatures. The temple loomed before them, cloaked in an aura of mystery and ancient power. Its towering stone pillars reached towards the sky, adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to tell the story of a forgotten time. The protagonist hesitated at the threshold, a sense of foreboding washing over them as they crossed the threshold into the temple's hallowed halls. Inside, they were met with a series of trials designed to test not only their physical prowess but also their mental fortitude. The first trial challenged their agility and quick thinking as they navigated a maze of shifting corridors and hidden traps. The second trial delved into the depths of their compassion and empathy, forcing them to make difficult choices that weighed the value of individual lives against the greater good.

Each trial pushed the protagonist to their limits, demanding unwavering resolve and unshakeable faith in their purpose. Yet, as they emerged from the final trial, battered and exhausted but triumphant, they realized that the true test lay not in overcoming the physical challenges, but in confronting the demons of their own soul that had been awakened by the trials.

With trembling hands, the protagonist reached out to claim the artifact, knowing that its power would forever alter the course of their destiny.\n\nThe protagonist found themselves at the center of a brewing storm, caught between the machinations of rival factions vying for control of the artifact's enigmatic power. Mysterious figures lurked in the shadows, their intentions shrouded in secrecy, while others openly declared their intent to claim the artifact by any means necessary.

Standing for a thousand years, the one hundred and forty-four crystalline columns represented the twelve months and the twelve muses... or so they said before its destruction.  When the first foundations were laid, the temple was for the goddess Ersloiene, and there were one hundred and forty-three columns, for the thirteen moon-months and the eleven passions.  That-\n\n\"Oh.  I see.  It is not *history* you are interested in, but a tale?  Not learning, but entertainment?  A shame... what, then?  Something noble and uplifting...?  No?  Something bold and bloody?  That is thirsty work, then, and my cup is empty.\n\n\"The wine will do... so.  There were many tales, bold and bloody, that were told of the times after the Age of Crystal, when the cities of the Mage-Kings were shattered, when both Gods and Demons were driven out of the mortal world... the flying city of Aelzo had fallen on top of the Jyau'thur, known as the City of Scholars, and much was lost.  The Great Empire of Conarlu, which once spanned the northern lands from sea to sea was shattered into a hundred squabbling fiefdoms... then only two score when the dead began to walk again.  The Knights of the Holy Fire were disbanded, and the Summoner Lords of the Spider Islands paid their final blood price... \n\n\"The Age of Crystal, the age of high magic, of great deities and devils, had passed.  The world was shattered by the collapse of the great magics, and then fed upon by the vultures and the fearful who tore apart the remaining shreds.  The Blessed Tree of Life in Pranthalithivlaristh - which kept illness and disease at bay in the the city since it was founded - was stripped of its fruit and seed so that one warlord's army could defy death for a single day.  And the tree burned afterwards to prevent anyone else from ever doing so -  though there are tales that a solder kept a seed rather than eating it, and later stole away with it to a far away land...  Like the tales of the Demon Lord of the Pit of the Black Flame.  The clerics of Ghalyunri paid a terrible price of sacrifice, but summoned him simultaneously to over a thousand summoning circles and shattered him.  Each fragment was battled and destroyed... they claimed.  Rumors of one escaping persisted...\n\n\"The world tottered uncertainty in the gap between Ages.  No one knew if history would once again swing towards an Age of Magic, or if it would be one of Steel and Blood.  The tribes of the jungles of Imarland grew bold, bidding to make it an Age of Voodoo.  But even deeper in the jungle, the spirits of the ancient beasts stirred, sensing a chance to not merely end the Age of Magic, but the Era of Man... and among all this chaos, there were those who strove to be noble heroes among the madness.\n\n\"Alas for the time, they tended to be shorted-lived.  And those are not the tales you want to hear... so, then, a tale of scoundrels and mayhem and adventure, in that gap of history, before the world steadied and a new Age started...\n\n-------\nNarrator notes: Don't expect a lot of images.  I'd rather spend time on the writing than hunting down appropriate and usable visuals.  While an image may be worth a thousand words, I'd rather see good writing.\n\nThe inspirations are: Conan, Frazetta's Death Dealer, Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, Thundarr the Barbarian, Beastmaster, cheap pulp fantasy, Thieves World (novels) etc.  Some amount of influence from things like Mad Max, the A-Team, and Cowboy Bebop (the anime series) - the main characters will be scoundrels mostly trying to survive and find some sort of fortune (and/or fame) in an age of chaos, but perhaps end up helping others while in the process of lining their own purses.  At least until they spend it all in debauchery and start over.  \n\nThe game will likely be NSFW and potentially full of stuff that triggers issues for some.  By that I mean, given the inspirations and settings, there could be scenes of loincloth-clad barbarians rescuing mostly-to-completely naked princes(ses) by beheading dozens of beast-men in a ocean of gore, followed by a certain amount of celebratory debauchery.  Not very politically correct or sensitive.  That said, it is not intended to be a story of Gor, though slaver traders, beast-men raiding villages to carry off the virgins, etc. could certainly be part of it.  The focus should hopefully be on the adventuring bit.\n\nAlso, while, hopefully, the characters won't get killed off, there will be the possibility of abuse, torture, branding as a thief, molestation to various levels, etc. - consider the Conan movies, in which the character is enslaved left for the vultures, etc.  So it would not be out of genre if Bad Things are threatened at the characters, particularly if they get caught.  Whether the threats are followed through with on camera, so to speak, will probably depend on the player mix.  It should be kept in mind that the setting is essentially post-apocalyptic in many ways, and even in places that seem civilized, the veneer of civilization tends to be crumbling into decadence, ruthlessness, or both.\n\nThat said, ultimately the camera focus should be on adventuring, swashbuckling, and some humor, not so much on the dark stuff.  \n\nCharacters should be human.  True magic, as opposed to trickery and slight of hand, is increasingly rare.  While characters may have magic abilities, they should be non-epic in scope.  Flashy magic will tend to get a lot of notice.  In general, characters ought to be able to, at most, deal with, say, 5 villagers, 3 thugs/town militia, 1-2 guards/soldiers/slavers, or, maybe, 1 well-trained/elite guard/soldier, under the right circumstances (i.e. ambush, etc).  This might be through fast talk, fleeing, combat, whatever.  If the character concept can behead all of the town militia or fast talk an entire squad of elite guards, then it is probably out of scope.  (i.e. no glass cannon/nukes, either.)  However, the characters working together might be a different story (and hopefully an entertaining one.)  This is not to say the characters won't get better as time goes on, but to give scope for the start.\n\nThe characters do not need to have a pure heart of gold, but they shouldn't be irredeemable, either.   They should have some sort of positive qualities.\n\nThe story settings will probably meander between some city-states of various sizes and local law enforcement, to smaller towns and villages, and some wilderness.  The exact mix will probably vary depending on how things go.\n\nMechanics-wise, feel free to create your own cards, though at the moment we need a thief-type and a muscle-type to round things out I think - or someone willing to take over Vlordraam.  I am not particularly obsessed with Strength vs. Weakness cards - that is, I can be convinced to let people play a Strength as a Weakness or vice versa (i.e. a Strength of 'Attractive' or 'Charming' might be a weakness if one is trying not to be the one the slavers pick, and conversely a Weakness of 'Hideously Scarred' might be a Strength in that situation.)", "story": "Name: Scoundrels of the Age of Crystal\n\nOutline:\n\nIn the dimly lit tavern, the air is thick with the smell of sweat, ale, and desperation. The main characters, a motley crew of scoundrels, sit huddled around a rickety table in the corner, their eyes constantly scanning the room for any sign of trouble. They are a mismatched group - a charming rogue with a quick tongue, a burly warrior with a heart of gold, a cunning thief with nimble fingers, and a mysterious mage with a dark past. Each of them has their own reasons for being there, but they all share one common goal - to make a name for themselves in a world gone mad.\n\nAs they drink and banter, they discuss their next scheme, their voices low and filled with a sense of urgency. They know that they need to find a big score, something that will set them up for life and allow them to retire in luxury. However, they are also keenly aware of the dangers that come with their chosen lifestyle - the law is always on their tail, and there are plenty of other unsavory characters who would be more than happy to see them meet a grisly end. But they are not ones to back down from a challenge, and they are determined to make their mark on the world, no matter the cost.\n\nAs the night wears on, the group of scoundrels continue to plot and scheme, their voices growing louder and more animated with each passing moment. They know that they are walking a dangerous path, but they are also filled with a sense of excitement and anticipation. They are ready to take on the world and carve out their own destiny, no matter the odds stacked against them.\n\nThe scoundrels quickly made their plans, gathering supplies and making preparations for the perilous journey ahead. They knew that the Cathedral of Heliodrus was a treacherous place, filled with traps, monsters, and other dangers. But the lure of the artifact was too strong to resist. As they set out on their journey, they encountered numerous obstacles and adversaries, testing their skills, wits, and loyalty to one another. The charming rogue used his silver tongue to talk their way out of trouble, while the burly warrior's strength and courage were put to the test in battle after battle. The cunning thief's nimble fingers proved invaluable in disarming traps and outsmarting their enemies, and the mysterious mage's powerful magic saved them from certain doom on more than one occasion. As they delved deeper into the ruins, they began to uncover the dark history of the artifact and the secrets it held, realizing that they had stumbled upon something far more dangerous than they had ever imagined.\n\nThe scoundrels continued their journey to the Cathedral of Heliodrus, the weight of their newfound knowledge hanging heavy over their heads. Each step felt heavier than the last, burdened by the responsibility that now lay on their shoulders. The charming rogue's silver tongue was no longer as persuasive, his words now tinged with doubt and uncertainty. The burly warrior's once unwavering courage wavered as he grappled with the enormity of the task ahead. The cunning thief's nimble fingers faltered as they faced traps that seemed insurmountable, and the mysterious mage's powerful magic seemed to flicker in the face of the dark forces they now knew they were up against. The scoundrels were no longer the eager treasure hunters they once were - they had become the reluctant guardians of the world, and the weight of that responsibility threatened to tear them apart.\n\nThe scoundrels continued their journey to the Cathedral of Heliodrus, the weight of their newfound knowledge hanging heavy over their heads.

No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.*\"\n\n**Samuel Johnson, in The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791) by James Boswell**\n\nThis is the tale of two cities, both are called London. \n\nOne city is the city seen on picture postcards and described in guide books. The city tourists come to see and commuters see in passing. The city eight million people work in by day and sleep in at night. The city which is guarded by Bobbies and is ruled by an elected mayor. The city where money is earned in the towers of the City and spent in the shopping streets of Westminster. The city that has been rebuilt after each disaster that struck it. That city is known as London.\n\nThen there is the other city. The city rarely seen on photographs and only described in fairy tales. The city tourists and commuters rarely get glimpses of. The city inhabited by a community of thousands and ignored by millions. The city guarded by Aldermen and ruled by the Midnight Mayor. The city where money is worthless and power and status are currency. The city that wasn\u2019t affected much by the Great Fire of 1666 or the Blitz. That city is known by many names. London Below, London\u2019s Shade, The Soul of the City, Londinium.\n\nThis is the tale of those two cities and those who live in both. \n\n\u201c*It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.*\u201d\n\n**A Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens**\n\n\nOur tale of two cities starts on 5 February 1952. Where in one city it is the end of an era because of the death of beloved king George VI and the beginning with a new era with the accession of young Queen Elizabeth II. In this city, the aftermath of the war is still felt and the end of the British Empire is an unwelcome reality. \n\nIn the other London a power struggle looms on the horizon. A new monarch in the upper world always is reflected as a struggle of dominance and control of the seats of power in London Below.\n\nThis is the story of those caught up in that struggle.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nThis story will start with six or seven characters. I have sent invites to those who expressed interest in the forum post: Magical London as a living city (https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfg/thread/kaswza)\n\nA lot more background information about this story and the background, plus some of the rules can be found there. \n\n***This story is inspired by many sources. The main inspiration is the Matthew Swift series by Kate Griffin. The Midnight Mayor, the Aldermen, the city sorcerers, the basic setup all come from this series. But it is only inspired by this series, it is not the law writ large. We\u2019ll be deviating from the basic premise in many ways. Sorcerers will still be the most powerful of mortal magic users, but I\u2019ve added a few other classes of mages not featured in the series. We\u2019ll start in in the fifties and in that I\u2019ve let myself be inspired by Grant Morrison\u2019s The Invisibles and the Doctor Who episode The Idiot's Lantern. Kate Griffin\u2019s series is quite bleak and I hope to have some of the whimsy of Gaiman\u2019s Neverwhere in this story. Other influences are the Rivers of London series by Ben Aaronovitch, Felix Castor series by Mike Carey, Alex Verus series by Benedict Jacka,Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke, The Night Circus l by Erin Morgenstern, and many others.***\n\n\nOn character creation: \n\n**All characters start out as human. They may have magical powers and abilities, but they are basically human. There will be many other supernatural beings in this setting, but I want the players' characters to be a human as possible, at least in the beginning.**\n\n**We start in 1952. This means that all characters should be part of that time. Research it if need be. So a young anti-establishment character can be a Teddy boy or a rocker, but not a mod, punk, or skin head. Older characters can be WWII veterans or if they're really old veterans from the Great War. (In creating the cards, I sometimes used art which isn't time appropriate, don't be led by that. So the martial artist may be able to navigate the city in a very athletic manner, it won't be called parkour for at least another fifty years.)**\n\n**We'll start in 1952, but the story will progress through the rest of the 20th century. Real history will be the background to this story. Characters will age, unless they have magic to keep them young. So starting out with a relatively young character is preferable.**\n\n**All characters are tied to London. They may have lived there all their lives, they may be recent immigrants, but the all have strong feelings for London, whether positive or negative.**\n\n**All characters have ties to both Londons. They once started out in London Above, but through happen stance they also became part of London Below, probably due to their innate magical abilities. It can also be the other way around; that the discovery of an aspect of London Below gave them their abilities. Whatever may be the case, they haven't yet cut of the ties with London above. They may still have family or other responsibilities there. They will also be relatively new to London below.**\n\n**London is an integral part of the setting. I want to keep it as real as possible. So the actual geography and features of the city will come into play. Familiarity with London will help, but you are encouraged to study up on London through Wikipedia, Google Maps, etc. Expect to be sent polite revision requests, if you make mistakes.**\n\n**We will write in a third-person past tense form. Your character's bio doesn't have to reflect that style. Be as creative as possible in describing your character. Journal entries, job interviews, stream-of-consciousness dreams, whatever you think is appropriate.**\n\n**We will need one of each Nature, so if you're late in creating a character, carefully look at what others have created. Some natures are optional, but I need at least one Alderman, one City Sorcerer, one Druidic Sorcerer, one Seer, and one Necromancer.**\n\n**I want to start this story on Saturday 10-1-2015. So take your time in creating your characters.**\n\n**6-1-2015 - NOTE: SO FAR A SEER, AN ALDERMAN, A DRUIDIC SORCERER, A CITY SORCERER, AND A NECROMANCER HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED.

This has been done previously in the world of fiction book writers with the shared universe concept, leading to long series of novels and story collections, such as Thieves\u2019 World and 1632. Many of the great IPs have used multiple writers to expand their universe, such as Star Wars, Babylon 5, Forgotten Realms, and the Cthulhu Mythos. This project is different in that those who want to use it will not have to pay the traditional license fees. If this goes very well, this co-created world will lead to fan-fiction on individual websites, published stories and novels, and perhaps greater projects. \n\nOne major drawback to having multiple writers is that the canon can be decimated by conflicting versions of the setting and elements, which is frustrating to all. Just look at all of the reboots of the DC comic universe, or even the recent multiple reboots just in the Spider-Man movie franchise. That is why an overall editor is needed. I humbly nominate myself\u2014my project, my sensibilities will the final arbiter, though I hope that it will be considered a light touch, and I will make every attempt to be fair and gentle. I also submit for free the PROCESS to anyone else who wants to create their own world\u2014take a look at the following, and see if you would like to join in this experiment and/or create your own for other genres. \n\nWe will create a world with detail, which means there will be some give and take on ideas, as we mash various ideas over and over, in order to fit all concepts together logically. A team player mentality is necessary. We also need originality, so, though this may be inspired by many previous IPs (intellectual properties) such as Deadlands, the driving elements must be new. For example, magic is part of this world, but we will not be taking the fear mechanic from Deadlands that morphs the environment when the Reckoners have put enough fright into the local populace. That story element belongs to Pinnacle Entertainment, originated by their writers, and bless them for creating it for their universe. This will be an original world, created with original ideas, and must be different from what has been done before. \n\nBefore going further, I will give the legal foundation, which explains the way in which this is different than most other collaborative creative activities, then delve into the beginning of the story elements. \n\n\nMETA-STORY PARTICIPATION\n\nContributors, and creators of derivative works, by the act of participation, are agreeing to the following terms.\n\nContributors release the intellectual property claims to anyone who uses their contributions regarding invented technology, gadgets, timeline, history, events, and organizations. There will be a list of specifically released world important characters, otherwise, characters remain the property of their creator, except in a use of mere reference. No one may use someone else\u2019s created characters unless it has been specified as a released character, except as in a minor reference. No one may recreate someone else\u2019s stories, nor use their created dialogue.\n\nAnyone may propose to create their own stories from this setting, using the above released elements for their own use, and release for free or profit from their own story creations in any medium, including, but not restricted to: posting on the internet; Storium games; printed and electronic role playing games; providing a story to a print or electronic magazine; publishing an electronic or printed book of a story of any length; contributing a story or stories to an anthology of fiction; create a collection of stories; radio shows; podcasts; television series or movies; a script for a motion picture. \n\nSome of the conditions to creating works in this universe are those found on the website run by John M. Portley, the instigator of this project, who holds the copyrights to this universe. At this moment, his website regarding this project is:\n\nhttp://www.john-m-portley.com\n\nPermission to participate in creating works in this universe begins by communicating with John M. Portley regarding the medium to be used, the title and branding to be used, and whether payment will be made or value exchanged in the publishing and/or performance of the work. Notification of any payment is to communicated to John M. Portley within one month of payment. If compensation continues to be given to the author for the creative work, then updates of the on-going compensation must occur every three months.  \n\nSwearing is not to be present within any works of this universe, nor acts of a sexual nature. Titles and branding must be changed if the copyright holder deems it an infringement of another\u2019s on-going or proposed title or branding, or if it considered in bad taste by the copyright holder, John M. Portley, or his legal representatives. \n\nIf an individual or collective profits from a creation that is set in this collaborative world, then ten percent of the revenue of that creation will be given to a legal charity, of the author\u2019s choice, and proof of the income and gift to charity must be provided to John M. Portley, or his legal representatives within one month of that charity payment. \n\nThe charity payment must be made once annually, at the least.\n\nFailure to the stated conditions is surrendering the right to publish anything within this created world, any and all profits from using this setting are to be forfeited to John M. Portley, and will subject transgressors to legal prosecution for infringement, defamation, and court fees.\n\nMETA-STORY\u2014STEAMPUNK WEIRD WEST\n\nThough I want to keep this open to most ideas, and encourage all to think outside of the box, I do have a couple of caveats upfront. I do not enjoy stories that take away a character's free will. I really do not see the point. So, in the desire to have consistency, the first guideline of this world is that mind control is something that will not be possible more than it is in our present world, and, by association, reading of minds. Time travel is not possible by any method in this universe. Aside from that, please generate ideas, even the crazy ones, and let's see what will work well together. \n\nWhat marvels of transportation and manufacturing occurred? What technology or alternative science developed? \n\nWhat mythological elements or elements of magic are true in this setting?  \n\nBecause of the above alternative history, what organizations and conflicts have developed?\n\nBecause of the above, what set of events occurred, and what were the repercussions?  \n\nWho are the important individuals in this world\u2014the movers and shakers?  Let's create a list of people important on this world stage that others can use. \n\nWith each suggestion, let's work together to flesh out the idea, and see what works well together. \n\nIf this world is built up by numerous contributors, then I will create a wiki website at a timely junction to collect the elements into an encyclopedia of this world. \n\nPlease put questions to the Narrator in the Commentary section. Please suggest new ideas or tweaks to previous ideas in the Scene area. Just start a character with some references for yourself, such as country and a brief background of time wasters such as your various jobs in your life and what particular entertainments that you enjoy (yes, I will require to know something about the individuals with which I will be sharing a world).

The protagonist's journey to acquire the artifact was fraught with peril, testing their resolve and resourcefulness at every turn.

In fact, the Galvan Coporation is on the forefront of understanding the Nova phenomenon, though much of what they know is still secret.\n\nNova powers are dormant until the person reaches puberty, at which point the power reveals itself, usually during a stressful moment in time.\n\n**What should I include in my character description?**\nPlease include how your character's Nova powers manifested, as well as a detailed description of your character's powers.

Europolis, an agglomerate of European cities including Paris, Brussels, Antwerp and London, has become one giant urban area. It is the center of Europe attracting many immigrants while the rest of Europe slowly descends into anarchy and poverty.

They begin to suspect that someone intentionally orchestrated their arrival and that there is a strange presence on the island with nefarious intentions.\n\nThe sun beat down mercilessly on the survivors as they emerged from the wreckage of their crashed plane. The island was lush and green, with towering palm trees and the sound of crashing waves in the distance. But there was something unsettling about it, something that made the hairs on the back of their necks stand on end. As they surveyed the wreckage and the uninhabited island, they couldn't shake the feeling that they were being watched.\n\nAs they searched for food and water, the survivors found more and more evidence that their arrival on the island was no accident. The wreckage of their plane seemed too extensive, as if it had been deliberately scattered across the beach. And the island itself was nowhere to be found on any map they had access to. It was as if this place didn't exist, and they were left to wonder if they were the unwitting pawns in a sinister game.\n\nAs night fell, the survivors huddled together around a small fire, casting nervous glances into the darkness beyond. They couldn't shake the feeling that there was something out there, something that did not have their best interests at heart. It was as if the island itself was alive with a malevolent presence, and they knew that they would have to fight to survive.\n\nThe survivors cautiously entered the dark, foreboding cave, their torches casting long, eerie shadows on the walls. The air was cool and damp, and the sound of dripping water echoed through the chamber. As they ventured further into the depths of the cave, they stumbled upon ancient artifacts and evidence of a forgotten civilization. Intricate carvings adorned the walls, depicting scenes of ritualistic ceremonies and strange, otherworldly creatures. The survivors were filled with a sense of unease as they delved deeper, the oppressive weight of the darkness pressing down on them. Suddenly, they came face to face with a chilling revelation that changed everything they thought they knew about their predicament. \n\nThe survivors cautiously entered the dark, foreboding cave, their torches casting long, eerie shadows on the walls.

It became clear that the island held a dark secret, one that had been carefully hidden for centuries. The survivors were gripped with fear and curiosity as they pieced together the puzzle of the island's history. The revelation left them with more questions than answers, and they knew that they had only scratched the surface of the island's mysteries. They were determined to uncover the truth, no matter the cost. Little did they know, the malevolent force was watching their every move, biding its time to reveal its true nature and unleash its wrath upon the unsuspecting survivors.\n\n\n\nThe survivors' hearts raced as they stumbled upon a new group of people deep within the cave, their intentions unclear. Both groups eyed each other warily, unsure whether to trust or view each other as threats. Tensions rose as they navigated the delicate balance between cooperation and suspicion, ultimately leading to a critical decision that would shape their fates on the island. The new group appeared to be just as desperate and lost as the survivors, but there was an air of secrecy about them that set off alarm bells in the survivors' minds.
