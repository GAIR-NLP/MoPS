{"id": "320c24b7-5cab-43b7-b14a-2b12ab81464c", "premise": "This story will take place in the Graceling Realm, a world that Kristin Cashore created in her books *Graceling*, *Fire* and *Bitterblue*.  It will take place a few years before the books, so hopefully there will be no spoilers if you're still reading them. Don't worry if you haven't read the books as I will provide you any information you need to know.  \n\n\nIn this world there are people who are born with eyes each a different color; these people are known as gracelings.  Gracelings are born with a special gift, called a grace, which is a greatly enhanced attribute of one type of another.  The gifts range in talent and ability.  A strong cooking grace could grant the ability for someone to make a masterpiece out of every meal, whereas a weak cooking grace would grant them the ability to make good food out of whatever ingredients they had, or maybe just prepare it in less time.  A strong archery grace could mean that every arrow will find its target, whereas a weak grace would be that most of the arrows hit exactly where they are aimed, and a few are just off the mark or they can shoot faster than normal.\n \nIn five of the realms gracelings are property of the king.  Once a child\u2019s eyes have settled, usually before they are of one year of age, they are sent to the king\u2019s nurseries.  There they will try to determine what the grace is; graces usually show themselves by age seven.  Gracelings are kept at court unless their grace is found to be useless.  While it is not uncommon for graces to be judged useless, it is a great shame to be returned home.  Gracelings not in the care of kings are generally avoided.  Commoners don\u2019t trust those with different colored eyes, so shops with gracelings get visited less.  They become a burden to their family if they are not disowned outright.  While most gracelings are known within their own kingdom, only the strongest are known throughout all of them.\n \nThe 5 realms that make up most of the Known World are Nander, Wester, Estill, Sunder, and the Middluns.  Nander is to the north, ruled by King Drowden.  Wester in the west, ruled by King Brin.  Estill in the east, ruled by King Thigpen. Sunder in the south, ruled by King Murgon.  Sandwiched in between those four kingdoms is the Middluns, ruled by King Randa. These five kingdoms are ruled by power crazy bullies and miscreants.  They are constantly warring with one another; creating treaties only to recant on them when the tides turn.  Gracelings in these lands are tools that the kings use against one another or for their own protection.  \n\nThe last two kingdoms, Lienid and Monesa, are said to have reasonable rulers.  Monsea lies past the mountains in the south, even more southern than Sunder.  Lienid is on an Island to the east, a few weeks out by sea.  As these kingdoms are somewhat removed from the others, little is really known about them.  There are, however, rumors that all the citizens are treated better in these kingdoms, including gracelings.\n\nYour characters will be from Estill, in service to King Thigpen. You can be between the ages of seven years old and 60.  You're eyes have already settled, you will be a graceling.  I'll leave it up to you whether it is a strong or weak grace and what that would entail.   \n\nThere are seven graces to choose from:\n\n1.      Beastmaster: You can read the emotions of animals and get them to understand your basic directions. Be wary though as many wild animals do not heed the wants of others.\n\n2.      Dancing: Your body is lithe and limber, you can move as fluid as any liquid. You never lose your balance and can perform various flips and aerobatics with ease.    \n\n3.      Desire: When you are touching someone you know exactly what they want at that moment.    \n\n4.      Sight:  You are stricken with fits where you can see scenes play out in your head. Sometimes they are things that have already passed, and others its things yet to come.    \n\n5.      Strength:  You can lift a cow as most people would lift a glass of milk\n\n6.      Swimming:  You move like a fish in the water and can hold your breath for a few hours.\n\n7.       Tracking: Most people would see a forest floor, you can see that a rabbit passed by an hour ago heading east. You never get lost, not in a maze nor even in complete darkness.  \n\n \nGameplay:  \n\n1.       When generating your backstory feel free to be extremely descriptive, but at the minimum let us know what you look like, and how your grace presented itself. You do not need to tell us how your grace works, as you will show us through the gameplay.\n\n2.       Please be descriptive when writing your actions, the point of the game is for it to read like a story.  Instead of \u201cJoe hit Jan\u201d, try: \u201cJoe struck Jan; his hand met her face with a sickening crunch.\u201d Currently the actions are set at the default 400 word maximum but if you need more space I can increase this. \n\n3.       Please do not write for others unless you received permission to include them in your part, or if it\u2019s something minimal like another character hands you an item, or simple responses to questions asked.\n\n4.       Use the comments section.  You can use this space to ask permission to include others in your story, or to try to coordinate responses.  You may also ask questions of me, like if you would like more description of your location or if you would like some guidance in where the story is headed/how to word your response.  OR you could just let us all know how much you\u2019re enjoying the game :)\n\n5.       Try to be timely.  I will \u201cnudge\u201d people who have not responded in a week.

Right now, good ol' \"City of Angels\" is a fuckin' mess.*\n\n*Name's Jack, kid, and lucky for you, I've got a few minutes to bring you up to speed. Don't know how much you pay attention to politics and the like, but LA is a free state. No Prince, no Camarilla sticking their noses in everyone's business. Live and let live is the motto. Heh, as much as any of us get any living done, anyways.*\n\n*Problem is, while the area's been stable for a while, in a city full of predators - Kindred and Kine alike - things never stay quiet for long.*\n\n*There's been a string of killings. All Kine deaths, so far, so none of the local big shots have wanted to get involved. Real problem is, they're getting more and more brutal, and some folk are worried that the killer might be a rogue Kindred, or worse. Long story short, there ain't too many of us what aren't under suspicion these days, yours truly included. Sure there's no official Camarilla presence here, but don't be fooled, they have eyes and ears in more places than I'd care to know, and if they're not watching you can bet one of the local barons or somesuch is on your tail.*\n\n*I wouldn't blame you if you got the hell outta dodge while you still can, but seeing as how you're one of the few suckers who's not really a suspect, maybe you could look into this. You got an edge here: until somebody throws the blame your way, you might be able to get somewhere other folks ain't been able to. Worth a shot if we can finally figure out what the hell is going on in this damn city.*\n\n*Whaddaya say, kid? Up for a little action?*\n\n***\n\nSince before recorded history, humans have walked alongside the creatures of the night. Vampires, or Kindred, in their own words, are perhaps chief among such nocturnal terrors. For centuries, those embraced by eternal death have walked among their mortal kine, hidden from human knowledge by all manner of deceptions.\n\nThe Masquerade, they call it - the set of rules by which Kindred hide themselves from their prey. Though there has been no official Masquerade in Anarch-controlled LA for some time, even the more foolish of the Kindred adhere to some kind of code. There is no benefit in being seen for what they are, and humans are numerous enough that they could overpower all but perhaps the strongest of Vampires, given the knowledge of their existence.\n\nStill, some Kindred choose to make displays of their power, rather than abide the deceptions of their kin. In Camarilla-controlled areas, these dissenters are most often hunted and destroyed by the Camarilla's powerful law-keepers. In Anarch baronies, there are no official enforcers of the Masquerade, but its importance is recognized and those who refuse to abide are often chased out or meet an 'unfortunate' end to their eternity.\n\nNow, in the barony of Los Angeles, a string of near-supernatural killings is becoming worse - and more bizarre - by the night. While it's not clear yet that a Vampire, or any other supernatural being, is to blame, it has become evident that whoever is responsible is likely not human.\n\nWhatever the reason, you have managed to avoid suspicion, for now at least. What is a nuisance for most could be an opportunity for you. Should you bring the killer to justice, or simply keep him from threatening the Masquerade, you may make for yourself powerful allies among the Kindred. Whatever your aspirations, political or otherwise, having powerful friends can always be useful, especially when you have eternity to use them. Be careful though - you can make enemies far more easily than allies.\n\nOh, and try to stay out of the sun.\n\n", "name": "Los Angeles: The Masquerade"}

It exists on and was built around the remnants of an older settlement, one sculpted seemingly out of a volcanic glass-like substance. The main artefacts from this previous civilisation are narrow bridges which stretch over the waterways and are traversable only on foot (and carefully at that). There is some magic in the world, mainly in the shape of various artefacts and a few mages who claim to have tapped the arcane arts. Whether this is true remains to be seen.\n\nThe social structure of Ethithenian society is divided into several tiers: at the top is the noble peerage (led by the Duke and his council), below them the servants of justice and the theocracy, below them the merchant class, and below them (in fact underground) is the Thieves Guild. The Guild itself has a complicated structure, nominally led by a \u2018capa\u2019 but devolved into gangs, each of which is headed by a garrista. Each gang pays \u2018taxes\u2019 on their activity to the capa, and all obey the Secret Peace, which forbids the Guild from targeting the peerage, the justice or the theocracy. In theory.\n\nYou are a small gang within this web, made up of only a few members who have somehow managed to carve out a niche for yourself within the city. Suddenly the plague descends upon the city but there\u2019s something strange about it\u2026 it\u2019s up to you to figure out what\u2019s wrong and how to stop it.", "name": "The Immortals"}

Food, shelter and fresh water are a hot commodity, but they will not be all that is needed to make it through this experience alive. Where did you wash up? What happened to your ship? Are you the only survivor? All questions that need to be answered if you want to know what dangers the island holds. Fight to survive on the island, or work to find a way off of it, either way there will be challenges to overcome before solace is found.\n\nSetting: It is the 1920's, a decade of prosperity for a large portion of the Western world. You were a passenger on a ship transporting goods across the northern Atlantic from Greenland to continental Europe. The ship upon which you sailed was called the \"Ithaca\", named after the island that the famed Odysseus called home. The ship was so named, so you've been told, because just as Odysseus made his way home to Ithaca after the war, though it took him ten years, this ship would always bring its passengers home, though the seas might be treacherous.\n\nCaptain Gibs is a friendly enough man. Keeps to himself at times, but sailing the seas for a living can get lonely if you don't reach out to people when you get the chance. He is extremely competent at his craft, and has proven so by sailing the Atlantic for over twenty years. When the winds start to blow and the seas get rough, he's the man you want in charge to make sure hope stays afloat, and bodies too.\n\nPlayers: Perhaps you worked aboard the Ithaca, or perhaps you paid your way aboard for safe transport to Europe, or perhaps you were a stowaway holed up in the bottom of the ship. Whatever your story might be, you've ended up on an island that was not in the ship's itinerary.\n\nEnvironment: The island is damp and cold, and the sun is often hidden high above the fog. The beaches are full of sharp rocks and all that seems to lie inland is a massive forest.\n\nThis story will embrace several themes:\n\n- Classical Mythology with a Contemporary Twist\n\n- Occult flare for the magic-inclined\n\n- Christian tradition and its Roman Catholic roots\n\n- Set in the Roaring Twenties, the atmosphere will be predominantly Anti-Socialist in most Western political circles, and predominantly Christian in most Western religious circles, but I encourage players to get creative with their characters and not to feel the need to fit into any generic mold.", "name": "The Isle of Goar"}

The year is 1899 and Boston is the hub of the steam-powered revolution. But, a small volcanic island in the middle of the Atlantic has caught the attention of many of the world\u2019s leading minds. An expedition was sent out by one of the leading minds, Ichabod Stark, but nothing has been heard from them in months. Flyers have been popping up around the streets of Boston seeking a new group to find out exactly what happened to famed explorer, John Williams\u2019, missing team.\n\n**___________________________________**\n\n**What:** This game will touch on a few genres; namely, steampunk and supernatural thriller. When thinking about the world you will be playing in, consider basic steampunk technology (steam engine, cogworks, and gas powered) as well as mild mysticism that you may find in a story by Lovecraft.\n\n**Where & When:** The first chapter takes place in a fictionalized Boston at the turn of the century. Although many things will be similar, this Boston will have a very Steampunk feel to it. The second chapter will take place on the airship Precedence. The details of the airship will be included in the chapter, but it will also have a steampunk feel. The third chapter will be the beginning of the scenes taking place on the island of Crescendo. The island is a mostly uncharted island in the middle of the Atlantic ocean.  \n\n**Who:** The characters are all members of either the crew of the airship Precedence or members of the expedition team sent to find the lost team led by John Williams. Each character will have some skill which makes them a valuable member of the team. Roles to be filled are hinted at on the two Nature cards provided, but any and all ideas will be considered. (Please look at the other characters to see which role would best fit in.)\n\n**How:**\n\n- I\u2019m looking for around 6-8 players, but I may choose more or less depending on interest and quality of applications.\n\n- From my time playing on Storium I\u2019ve seen that game speed is never guaranteed. So, although it will be set to normal, I will advance the story as quickly or slowly as I deem appropriate. That being said, I also hope that it level out to a normal speed and will do my best to make this happen. A lot of games start out very fast due to player excitement, so be prepared for this when applying.\n \n- I\u2019m looking for a more dramatic feel, but humor and romance are always appropriate. \n\n- Note on player control: Unless you have permission from the player which is expressed in the commentary or have worked together outside the game (ie, GoogleDoc) there should be no control of other people\u2019s characters being taken (this includes dialogue and actions).

Their mighty bodies make them formidable warriors, but their stubbornness and independent natures make them poor soldiers.\n\n**Zatheri**\n\nA mysterious people whose origins are cloaked in mystery. Standing anywhere from three to five feet tall, with lithe and limber forms, pale skin and elaborate abstract facial tattoos, they are commonly mistaken for Nekula, or human children at a distance. They possess a natural affinity for magic which fosters all sorts of speculation and mistrust among humans. Fanciful stories perpetuate that Zatheri settlements are floating fortresses above the clouds, invisible cities deep in some mysterious forest, or in caverns deep beneath the surface. Whatever the truth, these secretive, serious people neither confirm or deny anything and never speak of their homes.\n\n**Nekula (NPC only)**\n\nNekula are a race created by the Wizards of old as servants, and even some cases, familiars, but for their part in the revolution were given full status as citizens in the Kingdom. They\u2019re integrated into Human society, but due to their whimsical nature don\u2019t tend to make a large impact in society. They\u2019re commonly Artists, entertainers, bards, and rogues & simple laborers. Curiously enough they look almost exactly like the Zatheri, save for skins in various shades of yellow, blue, or green.\n\n**History**\n\nNearly 1000 years ago the Wizard Wars started. A golden age of magic grew corrupt and decadent. A unified organization of Human Wizards devolved into a handful of warring city-states that scoured and mutated the land and it\u2019s denizens. The Wizard Lords were eventually overthrown by an organized peasant revolution led by Manan the Liberator and his alliance with the Stonclan and Zathari people and the secret help of the Nekula.\n\n In the aftermath, the Stonclan were devastated by the war and were forced to throw in with Man to survive. The Nekula threw in with the Humans as well, exploring their newfound freedom while the Zatheri simply returned from whence they came rarely seen in numbers since.\n\nIt's been two hundred years since the forging of the The Kingdom. King Manann the Fifth has just been crowned as the new King after the passing of his father Tolrof the Wightslayer. \n\nManann V has an mildly unsavory reputation as a hedonistic, and unproven lout, but faith holds that his counsellors will keep him in check.\n\nMeanwhile others are tempted by the transition it gain wealth and influence on there own.\n\nOutside Kingseat's walls, the worlds troubles do not end. Between settlements the land is twisted and dangerous. The natural order is scarred, warped by the foul magics unleashed in the Wizard Wars. The very land can be bloodthirsty, to say nothing of the descendants of the armies of long dead Wizard Lords, bandits, ghosts and dragons.", "name": "Long live the King!"}

Or so it had been believed, before the Patternfall War.  The Courts of Chaos at the other pole of reality had brought war to Amber itself via their accursed Black Road, but had been soundly defeated.\n\nKing Oberon is dead, long live King Random!  Though chosen by the Unicorn of Amber, Random still has to deal with the scheming of his older brothers and sisters, and now, their increasing brood of children.  The Courts of Chaos are restless in their defeat.  And who knows what other threats may exist among the uncounted Shadow-worlds?\n\nPrince Corwin, one of the prime architects of the victory, has gone missing.  His son Merlin has gone questing after him and has also not been heard from in some time.\n\n--\n\nThe first Amber series is considered canon;  the second series is not, though I am borrowing some elements from it.  (Notably the Logrus.)  Basically, if it was in the original Amber Diceless RPG, you can consider it fair game.\n\nCharacters must be able to fit into the royal Court of Amber.  This does not preclude Chaosian characters - perhaps they were hostages taken as part of the peace agreement ending Patternfall, or part of the entourage of the Courts' ambassador - but I won't accept more than one or two.\n\nElders are not an option. :)  You can play a child of Oberon, but if so they have to be quite young, along the lines of Dalt or Coral.\n\nShadow characters are fine, so long as they have some means of traversing Shadow.  I'm open to unique powers for doing so;  in past Amber games I've run, I've had powers based on attuning to Ygg, to the Abyss, and even to Shadow-storms, just for reference.  I'll entertain the idea of Broken Pattern users too.  No spikards, I despise them. (Sorry. :)\n\nI'm including Natures for Amberite Royals.  You can make up your own Natures, but please follow the template of the existing cards - end the name with one of the four stats:  Strength, Warfare, Endurance, and Psyche.  That area is one in which you reign supreme among your generation.\n\nThe one tweak I'm making to the Storium mechanics is that if you go up against somebody in an area where they're supreme and you aren't, you can't win a conflict against them unless you can justify having an overwhelming or at least totally unexpected advantage.  (ie, Corwin beating the berserk Benedict by the Black Road.)  Generally this means you can't play Strengths against them, but I encourage creativity.\n\nYou can, of course, try to change the type of conflict to something more congenial, but that's risky - you may have to narrate getting wounded if you try to shift a Warfare fight to a Psyche one, for example.\n\n(Elders are usually supreme in a way PC's can't match.  There are some exceptions - a Supreme Warfare character could maybe beat Flora with a sword, for example.)\n\nDon't take the Pattern (or Logrus) as a Strength unless there's something unique you can do with it (and describe it!).  I'm taking Pattern (or Logrus) attunement completely for granted as part of the setting.  Trump Artistry is another matter;  if you don't have a Strength saying you can do it, you can't.\n\nSorcery, Conjuration, Power Words, and so on can be taken as Wild Strengths so long as it's justified from your character background.  If you want to learn one of those things (or Trump Artistry) in-game, talk to me in the comments.\n\n--\n\nTwo people have expressed interest who have not read the books.  For them, I *strongly* suggest taking one of the premade Royal Amberite Natures.  What this means is that while you look completely human, you are vastly stronger, faster, and more untiring than ordinary mortals, and you don't age after reaching adulthood.  (Though please don't make them older than maybe a century or two at most.)  You heal extremely quickly and can (over a period of years) even regenerate limbs - especially if you're supreme in Endurance.\n\nYour character doesn't know why they are different, or didn't until very recently.  Your background can be literally anything you can imagine - we're talking about an infinite multiverse.  (Though if you want to be from our own Earth, that would make perfect sense - Amberites have been hanging out here for centuries.)  We'll discuss in the approval process how your character came to the attention of Amber's Court.\n\nStrength encompasses hand-to-hand combat as well as the more obvious feats of strength.\n\nWarfare includes fighting with weapons, strategy, tactics, and leading military units.\n\nEndurance is how long you can keep going, how fast you heal, and how long you can keep using supernatural powers.  (Even without being supreme in Endurance, you can still last MUCH longer than ordinary humans.  Corwin and Random once made a bet to fence until one of them called it quits - Corwin begged off after four solid days because he had a hot date!)\n\nAnd Psyche is sheer mental willpower.  It's the raw power behind all the supernatural abilities.  It's also possible to engage in direct psychic combat, though my interpretation is that this is generally quite difficult to initiate without something to help enable it.\n\nIf you want some sort of magical powers, be aware they will only work in your home world unless you take a Sorcery Strength.  In that case we would need to discuss what the source of your power is.  Technological stuff does NOT tend to transfer well between worlds at all.", "name": "All Roads Lead to Amber"}

The plan was this: hippopotamus ranching._\n>&nbsp;\n>_Hippos imported from Africa and raised in the bayous of Louisiana, proponents argued, would provide a delicious new source of protein for a meat-hungry nation.

They were too large, too strong, and too irritable. The first herds - or 'crashes' - soon broke their border fences to roam free along the Louisiana waterways. They ate the invasive hyacinth, all right, but nobody could have foreseen the scale of the ecological shift that would occur due to their introduction. Insect populations flourised, which in turn meant more birds and more fish, who soon outstripped their pre-hyacinth population levels.

It was the DAO's mission to help contain the meta/magical world. This was easy when Metas and magic was \"hidden\", existing on the fringes and edges of society.  But times change and more are aware now of Metas and this makes the DAO's job a lot more complicated.

Food, shelter and fresh water are a hot commodity, but they will not be all that is needed to make it through this experience alive. Where did you wash up? What happened to your ship? Are you the only survivor? All questions that need to be answered if you want to know what dangers the island holds. Fight to survive on the island, or work to find a way off of it, either way there will be challenges to overcome before solace is found.\n\nSetting: It is the 1920's, a decade of prosperity for a large portion of the Western world. You were a passenger on a ship transporting goods across the northern Atlantic from Greenland to continental Europe. The ship upon which you sailed was called the \"Ithaca\", named after the island that the famed Odysseus called home. The ship was so named, so you've been told, because just as Odysseus made his way home to Ithaca after the war, though it took him ten years, this ship would always bring its passengers home, though the seas might be treacherous.\n\nCaptain Gibs is a friendly enough man. Keeps to himself at times, but sailing the seas for a living can get lonely if you don't reach out to people when you get the chance. He is extremely competent at his craft, and has proven so by sailing the Atlantic for over twenty years. When the winds start to blow and the seas get rough, he's the man you want in charge to make sure hope stays afloat, and bodies too.\n\nPlayers: Perhaps you worked aboard the Ithaca, or perhaps you paid your way aboard for safe transport to Europe, or perhaps you were a stowaway holed up in the bottom of the ship.

The beaches are full of sharp rocks and all that seems to lie inland is a massive forest.\n\nThis story will embrace several themes:\n\n- Classical Mythology with a Contemporary Twist\n\n- Occult flare for the magic-inclined\n\n- Christian tradition and its Roman Catholic roots\n\n- Set in the Roaring Twenties, the atmosphere will be predominantly Anti-Socialist in most Western political circles, and predominantly Christian in most Western religious circles, but I encourage players to get creative with their characters and not to feel the need to fit into any generic mold.", "name": "The Isle of Goar"}

This should also lead to nice character development and such. \n\nSo it turns out I like narrating way more than playing on Storium. With the three groups I already have making serious headway into the first simulation I'm just amazed at how different all their approaches to the same problem are.

The city is built for werewolves: there are tunnels and communal marking posts, public pots so people aren't popping a squat or marking where they're not supposed to be (that's a no-no), drinking fountains and doggy-doors (no handles!), not to mention wolf-friendly menus alongside humanoid venues. There's wolf-only fashion, including designer collars and kerchiefs, leg warmers, jewellery, hats, coats, shirts, whatever you want. People dye their fur. They paint their nails. They wear contact lenses and piercings and all kinds of ridiculous shit.\n\nAlso, this is the future. Clothes refit and size to whatever shape you're wearing. TA-DA.\n\nThe werewolves here shift anytime, anywhere. It's magic! Don't sweat the details.\n\nAnd everyone gets along just as they would if they were just regular humans. But seeing as how werewolves are regular humans half the time, that's just how things roll around here. There might even be butt-sniffing, but only while you're on all fours. If you're on two, that is just soooo awkward.\n\nBonus: Depending on what type of werewolf you are will determine how you look and behave. \n\n1) Some people are classic werewolves, who will shift shape only once a month. The ones that go berserk during this time tend to receive special treatment, or are on special drugs that help to calm them during this time. (ie. valium.) And there are some assholes who think this condition is catching, which it isn't. But they sure act like it is.\n\n2) MOST people can shift whenever they want. The only form available to folks in this universe is from human to wolf, with no in-between. The thing in between is considered monstrous and unnatural, and has been the subject of movies since the dawn of time. (Sorry folks, no anthro!)\n\n3) Some people have unfortunate genetics. Having received two recessive genes at once, these people are technically werewolves but cannot shift form. They are born as humans or as wolves and are forced to stay that way. There are charities for this sort of thing.\n\n4)  People can be different species of wolf, depending on their cultural backgrounds and nationalities. For those folks who come from countries that don't have native wolves, they tend to come in the form of whatever native canines exist in that nation (ie. coyotes, wild african dogs, jackals, etc.). Interestingly enough, the Grey Wolf appears to have existed everywhere at a certain point.\n\n* * * * *\n\nTHE STORY: So there's been a revolution going on in the city of Las Lupos forwever. It's considered a kind of old hippie movement that has been forwarded into a hipster movement instead. It calls for a return to the wild, where wolfy shapes were meant to run across plains and through forests, eating wild game and living in primeval packs. Activists range from mild to extreme. Most folks protest peacefully at government conferences or whatever, but the occasional oddball will set fire to things or even kill people to get their point across. It's been going on forever, and nothing much has changed.\n\nAnd then one day, the Alpha Cult incident went down.\n\nThere were cameras and helicopters, something exploded, SWAT marched in and were shot at, children were abused, cultists poisoned themselves, and the town of Borough became a landmark. In the middle of it all was a figure called the Star Bride, who, before immolating herself, declared a dire prophecy:\n\n\"By five rings the hand of man grasps two;\nFrom unearthly tunnels the Fen-Dweller comes\ntrailing six stars to swell the earth\nand from Lost Wolves\ngive birth.\"\n\nFor three decades the prophecy has been puzzled over by experts around the world, but no one is sure what it means.

The Danthesian people have never before experienced such wealth or serenity within their borders.\n\nSuch is the nature of the Empyrean rulers that they are only gifted to the mortal world for a short time. After 40 years of rule they must Ascend and return to the land of the Gods. By returning to their father, the God Otarion, they allow a new Empyrean to enter the realm of mortals and take up the mantle of ruler. This has been the cycle for nearly 700 years.\n\nOn the eve of her fortieth year of rule, Jaharet breaks this holiest of rites in the most unthinkable way. She refuses to Ascend. Ascendance is a ritual suicide, and by committing it she will shed her earthly form and return to the realm of her birth. But Jaharet's refusal, she claims, is based on the directive of her father Otarion, who wishes for her to remain in place as the ruler of Danthes.\n\nHer proclamation creates a potentially catastrophic rift in the country. The powerful religious order known as Pantheon's Call believes she blasphemes and that she must be made to Ascend lest the Gods become angry. The order begins to organize a military coup with the intent of capturing her and forcing her to Ascend.\n\nBut Jaharet is not alone. She has been a wise and benevolent ruler. Her reign has brought wealth and peace to the lands. There are those who wish to defend her and her holy birthright, who believe that the Gods really do wish for her to remain the mortal ruler of Danthes for time indefinite. \n\nAnd so, as the enemy closes in on Yistria with the intent of ending Jaharet's life, her supporters must rally together to defend her against Pantheon's Call.

Concerned that the deaths may be motivated by surprising new anti-witch sentiments, or perhaps are magical in nature, The Convocation of Witches employs a team of investigators to examine further.\n\n**OOC Information**\n\n*Setting*: \"New Chicago\" is an alternate version of 1920s Chicago. Historical fashion and slang are fair game. The city was rebuilt after the first World War. Huge technological advances, achieved through the combined use of magic and engineering, have led to a steam-powered society. Steam-powered motorcycles are the most common means of transportation; cars are extremely rare. Zeppelins are used to cross longer distances.\n\n*Magic*: In the last 30 years, witches have become more common. Propensity for magic is like any other talent - most people have at least a base capability for casting spells, but this talent must be practiced and further developed to reach its full potential. Witches are now common in every part of society. They function as teachers, doctors, entertainers, and more.\n\nThe types of spells that can be cast are still relatively limited. As witches continue to explore and experiment with their powers, more spells will be discovered. Currently, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, and minor illusions are spells known to many witches. Most other types of magic are not available at this time (but please feel free to ask if you'd like to use something and are not sure whether it would be possible in the universe).\n\nNon-witches are well aware that magic exists and is a large part of their society. Thus far, relations between witches and non-witches have been generally positive. The Convocation of Witches leads the magic community by settling any disputes that may arise and creating necessary regulations. In all non-magic matters, the police force and government function as they would in historical Chicago.\n\n*World-building*: This is a loose framework and you are encouraged to build upon it. The only set rules for the world are those I have outlined above, so if you want to create new places or history to fit the characters you create, please feel free to do so. As always, if you are unsure whether something you want to do would fit into the world, please ask me.\n\n*All of us are using Storium for the first time and many of us are participating in this sort of game for the first time.

{"id": "8d74a2c3-8982-49fd-9d68-93597a0a65a0", "premise": "A lot can happen in a thousand years. \n\nOnce upon a time, when the veil between the worlds was thin, it was an everyday occurrence for otherworldly creatures to wander onto our plane of existence. Magic and wonder touched our lives, giving rise to our myths of sparkling Fae paths, nymphs, divine oracles, and celestial dragons. Darker things came through, too, glimpsed in tales of Fae bathing in human blood and monstrous serpents gnawing at the roots of the world. We knew how to deal with spirit-creatures and nightmares back then. The solutions were encoded in symbolism and mythic narratives, embedded into our oldest stories: how to bind demons, how to exorcise phantoms, how to appease the guardians who defend the gates between this reality and the next and guard our world against horrors unimaginable. \n\nSo the veil between the worlds thickened, and otherworldly visitations slowed to a trickle. A Guardian was appointed to defend the gates, to be replaced every thousand years.\n\nA thousand years is a long time, though. Plenty of time for the old truths to fade into legends, and even those, barely remembered. Enough time to forget.\n\nMaybe that's why there were no omens to warn us. No portents, no prophecies.\n\nThat night, you came home from work, or classes, or another long day on the merciless streets. You turned off the computer, or you plugged your cellphone into its charger. Tomorrow would be another day. You'd fall into bed, the lights would go out, and you'd wake up tomorrow with your life set on repeat. The usual routine.\n\nYour dreams, however, had other plans. Or, it was something bigger than your dreams: processes first set into motion at the dawn of time, cosmic machinery that has ground on through the ages and remembered what we've forgotten.\n\nYou know this much: our world had a guardian, once, to patrol the boundaries that locked the nightmare creatures of the other planes outside. That guardian has been slain. *They* can tell, the primal horrors of our ancestral memory, entities of unending malevolence and consuming appetite. They've gathered where the veil is thinnest, poking, prodding, clawing, looking for a way through. If the veil falls-- well, that's encoded in the old stories. There are myths about wolves devouring the sun and corpse-goddesses reigning over frozen planes of eternal agony. However, there are other myths, too: stories of human heroes harnessing the power of gods and nature, performing heroic deeds and crafting miracles.\n\nThe veil between the worlds is tearing. You may be the last, desperate hope for its repair-- or the herald of its destruction and a new age.\n\nNOTE: Each character also stars in a one-on-one game that tells the story of his/her waking life.

The Captain, First Mate and a handful of the crew were here long ago but for most this is a new mysterious land. The ship has crossed several weeks of treacherous waters to get here. The Isle of Mystery is rumored to be full of marvelous treasure and treacherous danger. The capital city of the Kingdom of the Mermaids is rumored to reside in the waters around the Isle.\n\nThe Captain of the Silver Scar tells the crew that the treacherous trip was worth it as there is a secret treasure that lies here. Some of the crew rumor that the Captain has no idea where the treasure is and that the real reason the Captain is here is to search for a mermaid that Captain fell in love with years before. The First Mate, who was on the original trip, has become more and more anxious as the ship got close to the Isle \u2014 so far none of the crew are brave enough to ask him why.\n\nThe appearance of the Silver Scar in Siren Bay has the mermaids all atwitter. A ship hasn't come to these parts in some time and the mermaids are thrilled \u2014\u00a0just in time for the annual Mermaid Ball when the new Queen is chosen! The reigning Queen has held the title for four years running. Why does the appearance of this ship make the Queen nervous? Is the Queen afraid the ship somehow foretells loosing the crown to another? And what of the rumors that this same ship was seen here so long ago?\n\n**CHARACTER CREATION**\n\nAs you may have guessed by now, this game stars pirates and mermaids. You are welcome to make your own Natures as long as it is in keeping with the theme \u2014 yes this means you must be a pirate on the Silver Scar or a mermaid of some kind. No British navy, no island villagers, no silkies or were-sharks. I'm ideally looking for a relatively even balance of mermaids vs pirates.\n\n** MAGIC **\n\nPirates can't breath underwater and while Mermaids can breath in both they are useless on land as they can't grow legs and walk. Of course, magical treasure or other magic can change all this and will most likely be introduced during the game.\n\n**GENDER & SEXUALITY**\n\nThis game is queer-friendly. While in most fiction pirates are typically male and mermaids typically female, I encourage players to be whatever gender they want. Yes even the Queen can be male! I also encourage players to allow their characters to be attracted to whomever they want. We're not trying for historically accurate here \u2014\u00a0though, that said, sailors at sea have always been prone to what sociologists call \u201csituational homosexuality.\u201d It should go without saying that anyone bringing their misogyny or homophobia to the table will be told to leave.\n\n**SEX, VIOLENCE, AND ROMANCE**\n\nThis is designed to be a melodramatic campy game and the style of violence, sex, and romance should be in keeping of that: People are shot, stabbed, and fall off the side of the ship, only to return later with a torn up shirt, bloody bandages, a stiff arm, and a desire for vengeance. Romance is equally melodramatic with pirates and mermaids or pirates and pirates or mermaids and mermaids returning sweaty and aglow from loud crazy sex that always seems to occur off screen.", "name": "Sirens & Scalawags"}

The Nekula threw in with the Humans as well, exploring their newfound freedom while the Zatheri simply returned from whence they came rarely seen in numbers since.\n\nIt's been two hundred years since the forging of the The Kingdom.

It cleared away the complexities of politics, proprietary knowledge, and patents to allow the free research of cutting edge science and technology, and undertook to train an elite fighting force for global response to alien threats that might arise. \n\nBut the aliens never came, and the research bore only limited fruit, much of which couldn\u2019t even be used in the world outside XCOM. The Council of Nations funding the project shrank, budget and resources dwindled, and the project soon became a convenient place to offload troublemakers, weirdos, and other inconvenient problems. Its staff became a skeleton crew, its core mission a joke, and its command assignment a career dead end. Only a handful of diehard advocates on the Council kept the project from being entirely scrapped and its assets sold off to the highest bidder.\n\nNow, of course, the aliens *are* here, and this idealistic, atrophied dream is the only force capable of immediate global response.\n\n---\n\n**UPDATE FEB 20TH:** The war with the aliens continues, and pressure on XCOM personnel is only increasing.

While this shadow war continued, staff was hastily added to XCOM\u2019s base of operations in Brazil, and tensions mounted as the project struggled with budget constraints, secrecy, conflicting interests, and frayed nerves. \n\nUltimately, and despite the loss of one operative and injuries sustained by others, the XCOM project made great strides in beginning to harness alien technology and learning about alien physiology. Towards the end of the month, a bold plan was hatched: to truly understand the aliens, what they want, and how to defeat them, the XCOM project needed to bring one in alive.\n\n***In the month of April,*** the XCOM project made critical headway to its top priority: interrogating a living alien. Unfortunately, while XCOM solved the question of how to capture and hold an alien, attempts to capture one remain elusive. After two months of incredibly brutal missions, the roster is looking increasingly thin. Worse still, XCOM\u2019s management experiences a radical shake-up, as a new interim commander is put in place and a new Ops Chief imposed by the Council. With new initiatives and new operational patterns struggling to take hold, the project must continue to make headway against the alien threat.\n\nThe question hanging over XCOM\u2019s scientists and engineers centers around the new element, Elerium, the still-unknown substance Meld. and new aliens encountered in the field. Towards the end of the month, while the XCOM R&D division closes in on a breakthrough for improved field armor, the aliens abruptly change their tactics and start hitting urban populations in a campaign of terror. Finally unavoidable, XCOM is revealed to the public.\n\n***In the month of May,*** XCOM made many breakthroughs, both strategically and technologically. Now fielding prototype laser weaponry and alien alloy armor, XCOM succeeded in bringing in a live alien--and, later in the month, a *second* live alien, as well as a key piece of salvage from a landed alien craft. Unfortunately, public opinion continued to tumble after XCOM went public, as the organization is criticized for their response to threats, and for an especially bad incident in a small, Canadian fishing village. The appearance of a rogue organization, \u201cEXALT,\u201d resulted in even greater turmoil, this time extending to XCOM itself as EXALT proved they\u2019d infiltrated the Project, and turned key personnel against it. \n\nAs the month drew to a close, XCOM faced continually dwindling resources to protect the globe but wasn\u2019t ready to call it quits. They struck back at EXALT, neutralizing an aggressive cell in South Africa, and showed the Council their dramatic progress in facing the alien threat. But it wasn\u2019t quite enough. Facing increasing public pressure, France and Germany withdrew from the Council.\n\n\n---\n\n##Table of Contents\n\n* **[Scene 1-1: March 1st, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-1/scene-1)**, wherein the project is activated and operatives return from their first active mission in nearby Sao Paulo.\n* **[Scene 1-2: March 8th, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-1/scene-2)**.

Another operative is lost in attempt to mitigate the invader's terror attack on Alexandria while an extended response team arrives on the Condor to aid civilians. XCOM goes public, broadcasting worldwide the Project's mission. The base is a flurry of activity responding to the aliens' new tactics, addressing a MELD experiment gone awry, another cross-department get-together merging poker with group therapy, and the Commander giving XCOM's new Operations Chief an assignment: fixed operative squads.\n* **[Scene 3-1: May 3rd, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-3/scene-1)**. The Council is unhappy with XCOM's progress since activation and Canada is the first funding country to withdraw their support to the Project. The base recovers from a damaged power source explosion, trying to piece together what happened to trigger it and the information surrounding those present. The latest science breakthrough upgrades the existing Kevlar armour to a prototype Carapace Armour, and operatives put the new equipment through the paces while R&D begins the development of Beam Weaponry. Operatives undergo team-building exercises, and XCOM personnel from all departments participate in the Brasilia Underground League (BULL) season one.\n* **[Scene 3-2: May 7th, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-3/scene-2)**. Red Squadron returns from halting an alien abduction having abducted an alien, themselves. Ashlyn and Gabe immediately get to work trying to \u201cinterrogate\u201d this subject (even going so far as to consult Manny on sustenance requirements), while others in Science begin to reverse engineer alien weaponry retrieved from the field. Isobel and Ashur wrestle over how to promote XCOM and their failure to assuage Canada. Wekesa and Olivia make an unexpected connection. Del struggles with the increasingly thin Security duty roster in the face of a new security concern. Felipe and Issy continue to get closer, and he formally meets the other Valkyries. XCOM finds itself with another opportunity to down a UFO--but fails.\n* **[Scene 3-3: May 14th, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-3/scene-3)**. XCOM responds to a strange incident in a small, Newfoundland village, but there\u2019s something different about this operation, and it ends with three injured operatives and a UN airstrike. Back at the base, Ashlyn undergoes a psychological assessment, while Del helps out Torres with a difficult decision about her injured leg. Isobel and Gale struggle with feedback from the Council, and the former faces a difficult challenge after Newfoundland, with the world\u2019s eyes still on XCOM. Ashlyn makes a desperate gamble to settle complications from Tsobane and makes a ruthless move to finish interrogating the live alien before it expires--and is then detained by XCOM Security.\n* **[Scene 3-4: May 19th, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-3/scene-4)**. EXALT makes itself known in South Africa, positioning itself as a challenge to XCOM\u2019s actions, and taking local public opinion with it. Ndaba responds with a covert operation involving one select operative, chosen by Gale--a decision she analyzes as thoroughly as anything. Meanwhile, Ashlyn is interrogated for her affiliation with EXALT, and Gyorg is roped in by association. Isobel, as usual, is tasked with the public fallout. On the bright side, Del gets some relief in the form of new Security spending, but first he has to train them. Felipe is brought into ethically questionable efforts to keep XCOM\u2019s budget in the black. Emily struggles with the cumulative stresses of working at XCOM.\n* **[Scene 3-5: May 24th, 2015](https://storium.com/game/xcom-falls-the-shadow/chapter-3/scene-5)**. Nationalistic pride begins to rear its face on the base, with personnel getting into disagreements--or open fighting--about their conflicting loyalties. Throughout, work continues in the wake of EXALT\u2019s appearance: Wekesa continues his clandestine operation to infiltrate the group, while back in Brazil his team trains without him--until the time for extraction arrives. Elsewhere on the base, Gabe and Sahni talk with Nathalia Torres, a possible volunteer for Meld trials, while Ashlyn and Gyorg are given chances to redeem themselves. Emily makes a new friend on base. Valentina and Sarah take the first steps in starting a new club. ", "name": "XCOM: Falls the Shadow"}

In the north the fields lie empty, the populace killed by battle or plague, or fled to the rapidly overcrowding cities. The depredations of Gutar Kaarl seem to know no bounds, at least if the wild stories circulating among the refugees are to be believed. The city of Koldansk has thus far escaped the worst of the fighting, but after inflicting a crushing defeat on Duke Androlf, Prince Kaarl\u2019s army now sweeps towards it. Strategically straddling Garwek\u2019s major river, and placed at the foothills of the southern mountains, Androlf\u2019s political heartland, Kaarl knows he must take Koldansk to be able to advance into the interior.  With Androlf\u2019s army shattered, and his ally Duke Malheim trapped by winter snows in the mountains, Koldansk prepares itself for siege.\n\nIn this storium, players will take the roles of people within the walls of the beleaguered city of Koldansk. There are a plethora of possibilities, from refugees, war-profiteering merchants and mercenaries, to city elders, honourable soldiers, and noble lords and ladies- or perhaps even enemy spies! I hope that players will get creative with their roles, and that we get an interesting mix.\n\nThe tone of this Storium will likely be quite dark given the subject matter. Swearing, blood, gore are all acceptable. Sex and other NSFW content will probably be treated with a fade-to-black system, unless the players would prefer otherwise. Since the story is set in a city under siege, issues like starvation, disease and wartime death will all be issues I hope to explore, as well as the traumas of war attendant with such times of strife. \n\nThe setting and the story will be highly collaborative, with players encouraged to contribute ideas to make the city of Koldansk, its peoples and cultures and the war (everything really) more fleshed out, dynamic and generally detailed! There is no conclusion planned, so it\u2019ll be the role of the players to drive the story forward as they explore their subplots within the setting. With that said, I do intend to introduce some plot points if they are needed, or to shake things up once in a while. Players are invited to make up their own natures, strengths and weaknesses, and required to make up their own subplots (unless you want to use the default one supplied)! If possible keep the medieval manuscript aesthetic for natures/strengths/weaknesses- though this isn't required if you can't/don't want too.\n\nThe setting is an extremely vague low-fantasy (think Game of Thrones) at the moment, though this will hopefully change with player involvement and discussion. Non-human races are welcome, my only request is that we steer clear of the typical high fantasy tripartite of elves, dwarves and men. I\u2019ve set up a forum page where we can discuss the setting before we get stuck in, and while we wait for people to (hopefully) sign up here: https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/w9bx8s\n\nI\u2019m not a particularly experienced narrator, but I think this might be really fun!

Please direct your questions to the LFP forum linked above.\n\n***\n\n##__Notes on Character Creation:__\n\nIt is not necessary to have this in the bio, but please have an idea of the following:\n\n- What your character did during the Great War\n- Who your character's patron was\n- How they were admitted into the Club\n\n*A Note on Strengths, Weaknesses, Subplots, and Assets*\n\nOne of the things that sadly can't quite be replicated in the Storium system is SotC's 'aspects'.  In the standard game characters have six aspects, both good and bad, that they use.  Aspects are things that could fall under strengths, weaknesses, subplots, goals *and* assets.\n\nI have used the Occult Pulp Horror frame to build this game, but please feel free to make up your own cards.  In fact, I will strongly encourage this.  You can use the existing card texts if you like, but I would request you create your card title with a bit more 'flavor'.  \n\nFor example, your Strength card could simply be *Strong*.  But it's more flavorful if it's *Strong as an Ox* or *Man of Iron*.  If you're making a Weakness called *Dark Past*, that's great, but it's more flavorful if you consider *Former Cultist* or *Eye of Anubis*.  The same thing goes for your Subplot cards - jazz it up, make it your own.\n\nIn your notes to the narrator, please let me know if you'd like your character to have any specialized tools, machinery, gadgets, etc.  If your character is a master thief with an incredible bag of lock picking tools, let me know, and you'll have an asset once the game begins.\n\n##__Important:__\n\nOne of the most fun parts of creating characters in the SotC world is that, before the adventure begins, there is a framework to determine preexisting relationships.  That will be explained further once the cast is set, but to get the ball rolling on it, please submit in your bio the name of a novel starring your character and a short blurb detailing the plot.  The blurb should be no more than 2 - 3 sentences *maximum*.  Applications that do not include this will be sent back.", "name": "The Bride of the Winds"}

{"id": "e10623e1-38b2-4289-a33f-caae161b936e", "premise": "Countless ships are constantly lost to the stars. Legends and lore are told in taverns, around campfires, in bedchambers to lull little ones to sleep. The chief among them are the ships belonging to pirates, and one such story is that of the RLS TellTale. The vessel plundered and pillaged many a helpless crew upon a star voyage. She was heavily laden with her many ill-gotten treasures when she ran afoul of a Royal navy in the Crystylyne Sector. She went down with all hands, sucked into the nebulous pull amid the crashing ice clusters and colliding debris. She was never seen again.\n\nAt least, that's what the stories say.\n\n\nGAME INFO\nThis game is not strictly set in the Treasure Planet universe, but drawing heavily from that kind of world. Sailing ships move through the stars from planet to planet, humans and aliens together in a neo-Victorian sci fi universe.\n\nI\u2019m thinking in terms of a group of people who each have a piece of a map, but are not aware that what they have is a piece of anything at all. Jewelry, a key looking thing, a rather ornamental cog, etc, that will all come together to create a map very much like the one in Treasure Planet, but having it in cleverly disguised pieces that need to be put back together.  \n\nYour character's piece of the map should be metallic/mechanical in nature, or something glass or crystalline. Your character should not know it\u2019s a map piece. I don\u2019t plan to get real specific about how all the pieces fit together, so get creative with it. \n\nIf you want to play a stowaway who just happens to be there and doesn\u2019t actually have anything to do with map pieces, I\u2019m totally down for that. Same goes for crew members - some of them could have map pieces, but not everyone needs to, it\u2019s mostly how we\u2019ll pull in non-sailors and kick the plot off.\n\n**So long as characters will have their own personal reason for staying on the ship, being part of the crew, going after the treasure, and interacting on some level with each other, I\u2019m all for varied back stories, loyalties, and motives.**\n\nI\u2019m a narrator who is into very character-driven stories, so I hope for people who want to play fleshed-out characters and build the story, not simply blindly tackle obstacles as if they\u2019re playing an MMORPG. The more emotion and depth to a character, the better.\n\nCHARACTER CREATION\nFeel free to make your own cards when creating a character! The ones available are largely stock cards from the starter game that I modified. I tried to make sure everyone would have lots of options, but if you don't see anything you like or you're aiming for an already established character of yours, you can totally make up your own cards. Include an image on custom cards if possible.\n\nBe sure that weakness cards are a personal flaw, be in physical or a personality trait. I will not accept weaknesses like \"enemies\" - having enemies is not a personal weakness, it is an occupational hazard of those who muck about in other's business.\n\nHumans and aliens both allowed. If you choose to play an alien character, please include in the character information a little bit about their race you have created. I\u2019m up for people using creatures not really outlined in the movie itself if they want - anything anthro-ish, go for it, seems to be the rule of that universe.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThink of your character\u2019s profile as your audition to the game. Third-person posts only, in profile and gameplay, please. Past-tense or present-tense is up to you. I personally will be writing narration in past-tense, but do not mind if players prefer to write in present-tense.\n\nAdult language and violence are fine, but if clothes come off, fade to black.\n\nLight posing of other\u2019s characters is fine at challenge ends, particularly when it\u2019s obvious, (ie \u201cthey all ran out of the way of the cave-in\u201d or \u201ccharacter x dragged character y out of the way\u201d) but control of another player character\u2019s reactions, thoughts, words, emotions, etc. will not be allowed.

{"id": "4cb77dd2-863d-4cf3-a35e-f0def7a3a598", "premise": "This story will take place in the Graceling Realm, a world that Kristin Cashore created in her books *Graceling*, *Fire* and *Bitterblue*.  It will take place a few years before the books, so hopefully there will be no spoilers if you're still reading them. Don't worry if you haven't read the books as I will provide you any information you need to know.  \n\n\nIn this world there are people who are born with eyes each a different color; these people are known as gracelings.  Gracelings are born with a special gift, called a grace, which is a greatly enhanced attribute of one type of another.  The gifts range in talent and ability.  A strong cooking grace could grant the ability for someone to make a masterpiece out of every meal, whereas a weak cooking grace would grant them the ability to make good food out of whatever ingredients they had, or maybe just prepare it in less time.  A strong archery grace could mean that every arrow will find its target, whereas a weak grace would be that most of the arrows hit exactly where they are aimed, and a few are just off the mark or they can shoot faster than normal.\n \nIn five of the realms gracelings are property of the king.  Once a child\u2019s eyes have settled, usually before they are of one year of age, they are sent to the king\u2019s nurseries.  There they will try to determine what the grace is; graces usually show themselves by age seven.  Gracelings are kept at court unless their grace is found to be useless.  While it is not uncommon for graces to be judged useless, it is a great shame to be returned home.  Gracelings not in the care of kings are generally avoided.  Commoners don\u2019t trust those with different colored eyes, so shops with gracelings get visited less.  They become a burden to their family if they are not disowned outright.  While most gracelings are known within their own kingdom, only the strongest are known throughout all of them.\n \nThe 5 realms that make up most of the Known World are Nander, Wester, Estill, Sunder, and the Middluns.  Nander is to the north, ruled by King Drowden.  Wester in the west, ruled by King Brin.  Estill in the east, ruled by King Thigpen. Sunder in the south, ruled by King Murgon.  Sandwiched in between those four kingdoms is the Middluns, ruled by King Randa. These five kingdoms are ruled by power crazy bullies and miscreants.  They are constantly warring with one another; creating treaties only to recant on them when the tides turn.  Gracelings in these lands are tools that the kings use against one another or for their own protection.  \n\nThe last two kingdoms, Lienid and Monesa, are said to have reasonable rulers.  Monsea lies past the mountains in the south, even more southern than Sunder.  Lienid is on an Island to the east, a few weeks out by sea.  As these kingdoms are somewhat removed from the others, little is really known about them.  There are, however, rumors that all the citizens are treated better in these kingdoms, including gracelings.\n\nYour characters will be from Estill, in service to King Thigpen. You can be between the ages of seven years old and 60.  You're eyes have already settled, you will be a graceling.  I'll leave it up to you whether it is a strong or weak grace and what that would entail.   \n\nThere are seven graces to choose from:\n\n1.      Beastmaster: You can read the emotions of animals and get them to understand your basic directions. Be wary though as many wild animals do not heed the wants of others.\n\n2.      Dancing: Your body is lithe and limber, you can move as fluid as any liquid. You never lose your balance and can perform various flips and aerobatics with ease.    \n\n3.      Desire: When you are touching someone you know exactly what they want at that moment.    \n\n4.      Sight:  You are stricken with fits where you can see scenes play out in your head. Sometimes they are things that have already passed, and others its things yet to come.    \n\n5.      Strength:  You can lift a cow as most people would lift a glass of milk\n\n6.      Swimming:  You move like a fish in the water and can hold your breath for a few hours.\n\n7.       Tracking: Most people would see a forest floor, you can see that a rabbit passed by an hour ago heading east. You never get lost, not in a maze nor even in complete darkness.  \n\n \nGameplay:  \n\n1.       When generating your backstory feel free to be extremely descriptive, but at the minimum let us know what you look like, and how your grace presented itself. You do not need to tell us how your grace works, as you will show us through the gameplay.\n\n2.       Please be descriptive when writing your actions, the point of the game is for it to read like a story.  Instead of \u201cJoe hit Jan\u201d, try: \u201cJoe struck Jan; his hand met her face with a sickening crunch.\u201d Currently the actions are set at the default 400 word maximum but if you need more space I can increase this. \n\n3.       Please do not write for others unless you received permission to include them in your part, or if it\u2019s something minimal like another character hands you an item, or simple responses to questions asked.\n\n4.       Use the comments section.  You can use this space to ask permission to include others in your story, or to try to coordinate responses.  You may also ask questions of me, like if you would like more description of your location or if you would like some guidance in where the story is headed/how to word your response.  OR you could just let us all know how much you\u2019re enjoying the game :)\n\n5.       Try to be timely.  I will \u201cnudge\u201d people who have not responded in a week.  Likewise I will try to have Narrator responses done by 10pm PST the following day.\n\n6.

The players will all start as prisoners at a federal detention center within the city of Strangeways.\n\nAfter an event on Glass Island, an island just off the Florida mainland, a small percentage of the population were *changed* -- transformed into beings with super powers. This transformation was most prominent in the nearby metropolis of Strangeways with lessening effects the further the location was from Glass Island.\n\nAll of the characters will have the same source for their powers but virtually any concept will work except characters that are supposed to know \"magic\". A character that gains their powers from a power suit (such as Iron Man) is permissible but they will be at a disadvantage until they have time to build or recover such a suit. In such instances it might be better to create a character such as Armor from Marvel.\n\nThe Nature card that is chosen will determine the character's powers and they will be able to channel them by playing Strength, Weakness, and Subplot cards. Because of the overall power level of the game please try to minimize the number of powers of any character and make sure that they tie together thematically. Please feel free to edit the Nature Cards (removing the character examples provided) and insert the power(s) that your character has. For Example, a character that is an Energy Projector might be able to freeze things that they touch or even, perhaps, look at. It would also not be unreasonable for such a character to be immune to cold.\n\nThe game world is intended to be gritty so mature (R Rated) scenes are acceptable but please don't move beyond that without discussion first. Also, the powers of the heroes and villains will be very deadly to the non-powered. A bystander hit by a thrown truck is going to die. Freezing a civilian's arm is going to result in frostbite and possible amputation at the very least. The power source of the super powered heroes and villains will protect them from this level of easy damage so they can engage in the normal levels of action and combat that you might expect in a Marvel or DC comic.\n\nAt the start of the game I am going to try something, perhaps, relatively novel. Any narration will require the use of a card. This will mean that characters will be limited to three narrative actions in a scene and will be needing to address Challenges in some manner. This is an experiment and if it does not work well after the first scene or two we will abandon it.\n\nAs we develop the characters I may ask for several revisions so that we all have similar character conceptions. Please do no be offended by this. I am open to creation of your own cards but please note the caveats above.\n\n**Setting Information**\nStrangeways University is a research university located on the Florida Gulf Coast. It is surrounded by the city of Strangeways which is comparable in size to Miami, Florida. Strangeways was built by the military during WWII as a shipyard and the research site for Project Wormwood -- a secret weapons project that was eventually closed down due to a lack of weaponizable results. Off the coast of Strangeways is Glass Island, where Project Wormwood was housed. Glass Island is still restricted and maintained by the military though all programs have long since been closed.\n\nBecause of its origins, Strangeways University has always maintained very strong physical science, mathematics, and marine engineering programs. Other noted programs are its history and classics departments.\n\nSeveral crime families make up the organized crime underbelly of Strangeways with the most prominent being the Tredici, the \u0160erbed\u017eija, the Brannex, and the newly arrived Li's. Recently the Brannex crime family was all but wiped out by a villain calling herself Night Song.\n\nThe docks have continued to be maintained and are for the most part owned by CoreTechs, a weapons manufacturer with strong ties to the US Military.", "name": "Necessary Evil"}

The character is assumed to be of an adventurous sort, willing to travel the word in search of the unknown and to explore far places.\n\n- Do not create a grim, dark character.\n\nSOME RULES\n\n- Pay attention to the comments section. Use it to plan moves with other players, to interject out of character comments, to comment on anything.\n\n- Pay attention to what has gone before, prior moves in the same scene and the overall flow of the story so your moves are appropriate.\n\n- Mind the non-player characters goals and attitudes.\n\n- Don't steal scenes! If a scene requires a 3-point obstacle to pass, don't play three cards. Because you can, doesn't mean you should. Let other players participate. You can always play a card later.\n\n- Always justify the cards you play in the narrative. It doesn't have to be the character speaking. An inner monologue or thought is just as effective. Explaining his actions to the reader is also good (remember, someone will be reading this, so ask yourself: will they understand my characters motivations?)\n\n- Just because there's a challenge, you don't have to play a card. However, even if you don't play, your move must add to the scene or propel the story forward.\n\n- You can add speaking lines and descriptions of your own to the non-player characters and scenes. It's your move, you decide as long as it doesn't contradict anything that was established before or is against the element as described by the narrator.\n\n- Don't add speaking lines or actions to other player's characters, unless you both agree beforehand.\n\n- Above all: mind the game rules.

{"id": "5517f86f-f52a-40dd-977b-5972165f60c9", "premise": "*It could've happened to anyone. You were walking back home from the bar, a little tipsier than you had planned on leaving perhaps, but you still felt it better to err on the side of caution and come back for your car in the morning. After all, only live a couple of blocks away.*\n\n*You didn't quite feel like having to cross the street, so you thought you'd take a short cut through the local park, despite how the overgrown place always gave you the chills. That night, you felt a lot braver than usual, or perhaps you were simply much dumber than usual. Either way, you started on the concrete path through the park, but as you went further along this normally bare path, you began to notice that the grass seemed to spill over in unexpected areas or even pop up out of cracks you hadn't remembered seeing there before... as if they had just grown in to try and trip you up.*\n\n*You kept walking, humming a soothing tune to yourself as the bushes seemed to spring up closer and closer to your path and had far more thorns than you remembered seeing on previous walks... and then the branches on trees seemed to hang lower, forcing you to duck under them with alarming regularity. And then you heard the hungry growl of a great beast... one not five steps behind you. Without thinking, you run further into this strange section of the park, even though you know you are simply getting yourself even more lost than you were before. The beast never seemed to lose pace with you, however, at least not until you ran headfirst into that impossibly tall, and impossibly beautiful woman. In the strange light that permeated from nearby fruits in the trees, she appeared to have dark green skin, like the Wicked Witch of the West with her version of a deep tan... but her features resemble a dark elven sorceress, with her long pointed fingers and equally pointed ears, and above all, her piercing... alluring gaze.*\n\n*The woman offered help, you hastily accepted, even as she rapidly spoke in an ancient tongue you didn't understand, drafting up a binding verbal contract... and then the strange wolf-creature that had been chasing you abruptly stopped and ran off in some other direction. It was only then, as the woman smiled, that you noticed how she had been eying you with a predatory gleam... and her rows upon rows of shark-like teeth only served to enhance that feeling. She took a large bite out of your neck, and before you could fully fall onto the ground screaming in pain, she caught you and carried you in her arms with the gentleness of a new mother.*\n\n*After that, time became a bit fuzzy for you, you remember climbing on spires of the clearest emerald green water you've ever seen that rose up out of the font of an active volcano... dining on fallen stars shortly before your mistress decided to indulge her unusual bedroom appetites... devouring you in more ways than one and healing you every step of the way... sparing none of the unspeakable pain of flesh being rent and torn and then stitching itself back together, of bones breaking into powder and then reforming, though not quite as they once were... and neither did she spare you the mind-warping pleasure of herself... how her every touch seemed to send waves of pure ecstasy raging through your body, to say nothing of the more intimate pleasures she subjected you to.*\n\n*Immediately afterwards of course, this impossibly exotic creature put you to grueling and exhausting work, hunting through the strange forests for the hardest to reach fruits... and while you sampled some of them to see how they affected you and how they might affect your mistress, you had a rare moment of clarity... you woke up from the intoxicating haze you'd been living with for so long to realize just how much of a nightmare you had been living. And then you remember your girlfriend, who you had thought about marrying before you had been taken. You wonder how long it has been, and whether she misses you or has already moved on... or even how long it has really been. Either way, you make your decision, you latch onto the strongest memory of her you have - a bitter argument over your drinking, and you hurriedly retrace your steps through the Hedge and back out where you came from... back to your hometown.*\n\n*Despite knowing that things were tense when you last saw her, you rush to her place, desperate to have her hug you, tell you how much she missed you and how she'll never let you out of her sight again. Only, you find that she is moving out. There is a wedding ring on her finger, and as you watch from the bushes, she embraces a young thing that looks very much like you, a little older perhaps, but still... its you. Then you look down at your hands and you see the shriveled, pale little wretch you have become and you slink away, utterly lost at what to do next.*\n\n---\n\n**Fair Warning: This game is flagged as NSFW because it'll likely involve a good amount of swearing, fairly graphic depictions of violence, quite likely sex and drug use... as exploring themes of abuse and dealing with abuse, and other disturbing, adult themes. Its a World of Darkness game, it'd be weird if it WERE entirely SFW.**\n\nOkay, this story is loosely based on the New World of Darkness game, *Changeling: The Lost*. In that game, you are abducted by one of the True Fae, it doesn't really matter what you were doing at the time, you might've been taking out the trash, walking through a park, you might have even unknowingly helped one of the True Fae out, and unknowingly insulted them in the process or broke some law of theirs you didn't know about and probably couldn't understand. In any case, they abducted you, tortured you, abused you, put you to work, maybe sexually abused you (or worse, made you think it was entirely consentual at the time, or much worse, made you think you were in love), and quite likely abused you in ways we don't have words for. That abuse changed you. The food and drink changed you. The very strange land with all of its terrible beauty, changed you. The tasks you were put to changed you. Everything you did or was done to you in this strange realm, in Arcadia, changed you.\n\nYour Keeper (the True Fae or Gentry as they are sometimes called who is keeping you prisoner) dragged you through the Hedge, where the Thorns tore right through your flesh and did a number on your mind and soul as well... leaving you unable to remember much of your mortal life. And it is through this Hedge, the barrier between the mortal world and the mad realm of Arcadia/Faerie, that you tried to escape back through... possibly multiple times before succeeding.... only a single, powerful memory to guide you back to where you came from. And once back in the mortal world, you begin to recover some of your mortal memories, and realize you have lost many of your memories of Faerie. A small mercy perhaps... but one that could leave you vulnerable if your Keeper ever decided to come after you.\n\n----\n\nThis story will focus on a community theatre troupe that are all abducted, one after the other, by the same True Fae... and thus all have the same Keeper. They suffer together, they escape together...\n\nand they try to make their way in the mortal world together. Try to form their own little hidden society within their hometown. And above all... how do you deal with your time in Faerie? Do you mourn it? Do you miss it? Does it make you wish you had never been born? Do you try to work through your pain? Or do you simply wish to forget... to lose yourself to the pleasures the mortal world has to offer?\n\nOr do you want to fight back?\n\nIn any case, you will all struggle together to build something positive, something that might outlast you. Over time, other Changelings start to appear in the city, and it is up to you to guide them, to help them. And of course, other supernatural groups start to take an interest... mages, vampires, and other strange things that go bump in the night start to notice you. How do you deal with them?\n\nAbove all though, you dread the day that the True Fae come to look for prey... to recapture you, to drag you back through the Hedge and back into that wonderful hellhole they call home.\n\n**Notes on Character Creation**\n\nEveryone in this game has the same Keeper, who will be defined both by what you guys remember about her and some ideas I had in mind. Unlike most Keepers who idly abuse their mortal victims, this one deliberately reshaped all of you into resembling various fairy tale characters. I might also accept some characters from legend, or some fantasy novels (no Harry Potter thank you... too recent) like *Lord of the Rings*, or *The Wizard of Oz*, or anything else written before the 1980's. \n\nNature cards aren't intended to exactly match any one fairy tale character, but are meant to be used as archetypes that form the core of your character's personality, the elements that may shift around a little, but are almost always present. You are free to make your own, but try to keep it in line with the overall themes... fairy tales, abuse, scattered memories of two very different lives, etc. \n\nMake Strenghts and Weaknesses however you like, just be sure to read the tips I left on the \"example\" cards for those. Same thing with the Subplots... but note that these should resemble the key aspect/s of your mortal life that drew you back through the Hedge from Arcadia.\n\nCard art is optional, but recommend, especially if it represents the warped way your character sees their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nAvatar art is also optional, but much more strongly recommended, but keep it to your character's human appearance.\n\nSee, in Changeling... almost all mortals, and most non-Changeling supernaturals can't see past the Mask, the unconscious illusion of being a normal human that you project at all times, even after death. It takes a good deal of effort to make others see your Fae Mein... you new, true, and much more alien appearance.\n\nSo Avatar Art should just be your Mask, what most people think you look like.\n\nAbout your main bio, it can be anything... a third-person description of key events in your life, to a journal entry, to a short writing sample... whatever... as long as you keep it strictly to the events of your mortal life. Because this story will start with your last couple of days in Faerie, with your last escape attempt.\n\nUnderneath your bio, you should include the following:\n\n**Age:** First, the age you were when you left Faerie, and then your age when you got back. Due to how weird time can be in Arcadia, these may not match up that well. Just keep in mind that as you get older in Faerie it becomes more difficult to remember anything that is still relevant to your hometown to bring you back through the Hedge... and if you went in too young, you might not have any strong memories of your hometown.\n\n**Physical Description:**\n\n**Mental State:** Describe your character's current mental state... any forms of insanity they might have, any long-term goals they might have, any new desires they didn't have before, etc.\n\n**Likes:**\n\n**Dislikes:**\n\n**Fears:**\n\n**Mortal Family/Friends:** these are quite likely the people you want to reconnect with, but more than likely can't because of your Fetch. \n\n**Fetch:** Your Fetch is your double, your magical twin that your Keeper left in your place to ensure no one asked any questions about where you have been. To make sure no one missed you. They are almost exactly like you, but might be missing certain qualities. Subtle personality traits that aren't quite there... might be negative, might be positive. So when describing your Fetch, be sure to describe both how you are different and how you are the same.\n\n**Seeming:** If you know the game already and know what this means, then great, go ahead and pick one! Hell, pick a Kith as well if you want. (sorry, no Entitlements or Courts though). If not, then let me know in the character sheet comments and I'll do my best to help you figure out which Seeming fits in the most with your overall concept.\n\n**Contracts:** These are the powers that you got out of your time in Faerie. Again, if you know that game feel free to use any from the tabletop game that you want. If you don't know the game or would rather make something up to better fit your character then go ahead. Just know that you can only have up to five different powers. They should thematically fit in with your character... and the character that your Keeper wanted them to resemble... and they should have a Catch... a strange condition or dire price you must pay in order to use the Contract.\n\n**Occupation:** What you did for a living before being abducted. This might hold true after you escape, but can't be certain.\n\nLastly, here are some helpful resources...\n\nReview by the Gentleman Gamer... gives some technical information but also gives you a good feel for the game.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hV5e_lx0n38\n\nAnd for more technical information, here's a handy website that a good friend of mine, TimeLady pointed me to: http://www.thesubnet.com/portal/wod2/ctl/", "name": "Changeling: Theatre of the Lost"}

Enter the Hoffman Project, a CIA black operation where agents have been injected with dark matter which has been found to cause mutations, giving the recipients (the ones that survive the process) incredible powers.\n\nUnder the guise of the Hoffman Institute, an independent \u201cthink-tank\u201d organization devoted to furthering mankind's knowledge, preserving art, investigating the unknown and exploring history, the CIA's Hoffman agents roam the globe fighting against the encroaching tide of communism and other threats against America.\n\nSprinkled with influences from Alias, Leverage, Mission Impossible, and the X-Files among others, the Hoffman Project will see dark matter infused agents performing missions for the CIA's black ops department as well as maintaining their cover story by investigating matters that would fall under the purview of the Hoffman Institute.\n\nCHARACTER SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nThis story will not be on a first come, first serve basis; I will evaluate all applicants and their submissions and may request revisions. This is NOT an uber-powered supers game, powers should be subtle and not overt. Keep that in mind when thinking about your powers...no flying, laser eyes, etc.\n\nSome examples for use or inspiration, some of these can't be used as listed but it's a good reference point: <http://bit.ly/1tkbKi3>\n\nI am looking for 3-4 (but may take a 5th if it's really good) participants to help tell this story. The chapters will be divided into \"missions\" with episodic television our guideline.\n\n1) Select one of the listed natures (custom ones not accepted) and develop your power based off of the theme of that agent type. Your nature and power should flavor your posts.\n\n2) Ideally only one of each type of agent (nature) will be accepted to have a well rounded team. However multiple of the same may be accepted if the differences warrant it...check out the existing and/or pending characters.\n\n3) Strength and weaknesses are pretty well developed as well; I will accept custom ones of these if they follow a similar pattern and theme.\n\n4) I have listed a few subplots as ideas but am looking for custom and fleshed out ones here that fit your character...be creative.\n\nAdded bonuses if you add pictures where there are none to reflect your character.\n\nSTORY NOTES\n\nThis game is being developed for a slow burn and for the long haul. I've listed 2-3 scenes a week which should be fine, but we may go slower or we may go faster. Communication between narrator and participants is CRUCIAL. Weekend and holiday posting is 100% optional.\n\nBecause of the planned episodic nature with the chapters, we can have characters \"sit out\" missions if you need a break. We can also introduce other agents as needed. \n\nDo not be afraid of weak or uncertain outcomes! I plan on challenging you here, so (hopefully) you won\u2019t have enough cards to make them ALL strong. Expect to play off the other characters! Don\u2019t step on each others' toes, but there WILL be some writing for each other. So keep this in mind when making characters.

I'd like for characters in this story to be discovering themselves slowly, and perhaps not at all happily.  They could all band together, or break into factions.  They might want to stay underground or rise up and create a new order.  What happens will be up to the people playing.\n\nI expect this to be a fairly dark and adult story and welcome horrible things happening to good people. :)  It's also my desire to avoid character deaths, though NPCs may be sacrificed to our heart's content.

Wrestlers from all over the universe, from every planet and race, compete to reach the ultimate title of Undisputed ISMW champion. Do you have the guts and grit to make it to the top?\n\n**Tone and setting:**\nIts anime meets WWE meets tele-novella in this ridiculous and over-the-top the wrestling world. You may find yourself in an electric-laser cage match on the receiving end of a 10 flip powerbomb from 20 feet up, or caught in the crushing bearhug of a 6 armed alien-demon. \n\nRidiculous\u2026but realistic: The game should have a cartoony feel with over-the-top moves and characters (see 10 flip powerbomb above), but maintain some element of realism. You need to use your judgement for the betterment of the story. \n\nExample 1: You may get pile-drivered from a rockman after he jumped 10 feet up and you still kick out (because it\u2019s just one of his regular moves), but if a friend of his runs interference and hits you in the back of a head with a golf-club, you may get knocked out a lose the match (Wrestling logic applies)\n\nExample 2:,You might be a small, acrobatic character fighting an 800 lbs sumo. Throughout the match, you shouldn\u2019t be able to lift him up, and will need to write accordingly. However, if at the end of the match, you get a heroic 2nd wind, and defy logic by picking him up for your finisher (think anime logic).\n\n**How the game works:**\nLike a \u201cChoose your own adventure\u201d but with more spandex...\nWe\u2019ll be using the Storium card mechanics but with a slight change up to make sure the game stays interesting and unpredictable for players. At the end of every move made by the Narrator, I\u2019ll give the characters challenges on how they start their next course of action (e.g. Perhaps a move, option to cheat or play it straight, etc). Depending on the choices made (Strong/Weak outcomes), and how interesting you make your scenes in the match will determine if you win or lose. The outcome of each match will be decided by the Narrator.\nWhen players make great moves or write really compelling scenes, they may score bonuses  like \u201cExceptional kick-out\u201d which they can play in any match to sway outcomes in their favour. \n\n**Tips to win:**\n-Stay true to your character (If you\u2019re a baby-face, don\u2019t grab a chair and cheat, and if you\u2019re a heel, DO grab that chair!)\n-Don\u2019t always make yourself have control of the match all the time. Keep the pacing realistic and interesting. If you\u2019re up against a much stronger opponent, maybe jobbing the match could be more interesting for the story and get you some bonuses\n\n**Flow of the game:**\nthe ISMW league airs it\u2019s episodes once a week (Monday Night Muscle Madness!). At the beginning of each episode or Pay-per-view, I\u2019ll post line up of matches, type of match and the order they happen in. Sometimes, it might be required that players need to have backstage/locker room/interview scenes as they wait for other matches to finish if chronology is critical to the scene (e.g. One of your friends is getting ambushed in the ring by a ton of heels, and you need to come in and save the day before/after your own match). \n\nMost importantly\u2026 Have fun!\n\n\n*Game inspired by the Anime Kinnikuman*\n\n\n**Wrestler backgrounds and Moves**\n\n**Alexei Astrovic**\nSpecial Move: Asteroid Smash (Alexei jumps onto the ropes, uses them to catapult up and comes does 5 ganor flips before landing on his opponent in a pinning combination.\nSignature moves: Super-kick, Flying out of the ring somersault splash\nEntrance: Up-beat techno music with a lot of lasers\nBackground: Alexei grew up in the Russian farming colony of New Moscow. From a young age, his parents instilled in him a strong work ethic and unwavering sense of right and wrong. Using the gifts his parents gave him, Alexei would spend his nights working out and practicing high-flying stunts onto hay-bails in his family\u2019s barn. When he was finally of age, he started competing in local wrestling matches, quickly rising the ranks and capturing the hearts of the fans. Now at 24, he\u2019s one of the youngest wrestlers in ISMW.\n\n**Shuma-Goran**\nSpecial move: Spider Hold (standing behind his opponent, Shuma uses his 6 arms to lift up and stretch out his opponent in a devastating submission hold: 2 hands pull back on the head, 2 arms grabbing his opponent\u2019s arms and his 2 lowest arms pull back on his opponent\u2019s legs. \nSignature moves: 6-armed bearhug, Shuma-driver Pile-driver (Lifts his opponent up like a suplex, and uses his 6 arms to stretch their arms and legs out before he drops to the ground in a spoke pule-driver suplex).\nEntrance: Creepy music with gongs and bells\nBackground: An alien demon from the planet Hades 9, Shuma-Goran will stop at nothing to prove that he is the most powerful wrestler in all the united galaxies.\n\n**Dallas Steel**\nSpecial Move: Rodeo Slam (Pick opponent up in a fireman\u2019s carry and then swings them by their head in a 720 degree circle into a stomach slam (think Brock Lesnar\u2019s F5 but with 2 full spins)\nSignature moves: Flying clothesline, Drop kick, Belly-to-belly suplex\nEntrance: Rock music with red/white/blue pyro technics from the ground\nBackground: Dallas loved the ISMW league since he was a kid and spent his life dreaming of becoming a pro wrestler. His idol was and still is Horus Hercules, which is why Dallas\u2019 style emulates that of the former champ: play by the rules, never-give up and be kind to your fans. He\u2019s lived by that motto since his first day in the ISMW league and so far, it\u2019s worked out pretty well for him.\n\n**Jonny Atom**\nTBC\n\n**Horus Hercules**\nTBC", "name": "Intergalactic Super Muscle Wrestling"}

It engulfed twelve colonial Core regions of deep space until it came to a tenuous end--where some Cores are ruled by militaristic regimes, others by dictatorships or organized crime, and still others by shaky presidencies. Some veterans of the Cores War make their post-war living as vessel extractors, known with derision among the Cores as scrapjacks. Scrapjacks skate the line between piracy and legitimacy among unstable colonies rife with underhanded business practices and corrupt government officials. Trying to repossess illegally seized freighters or decommissioned military ships can prove dangerous, but scrapjacks are well-entrenched in the seedy underside of colonial life, willing to use questionable tactics for the greater good of their clients. They are paid well, considered indispensable by some, and free to move about the Cores with relative anonymity. Clients go to great lengths to guard their jacks\u2019 identities from those who fall victim to a scrapjack\u2019s \u201cship liberation\u201d... but it sometimes causes more trouble than even a few million cred can fix.*\n\n**The Setting**\n\nThe recently opened Marionette Station of V Core has concluded its inaugural ceremonies and is now open to the public.

Or, welcome to Bossier-City, also Louisiana. Really, take your pick \u2014\u00a0There's nothin' but water and magic between 'em. And like some are thirsty for water, you're thirsty for the magic.\n\nOh yeah, no question. Magic's real. I mean, it's hidden; magicians call the magic subculture 'the esoteric' because it's weird and you don't talk about it. But it's real, no question about that \u2014 You've seen it, touched it, and can *do* it.  You're not great at it, mind you, but you've got the knack, and understand the limits. It starts small. Here's a few examples:\n\nLaurie figured out that dreamcatchers really work, if you make them with old videotape instead of thread, and a small bit of 'kick' in the middle. She wears one around her neck, and she picks up on surface thoughts around her. \n\nMichael gets it: 'Skill' and 'talent' is bullshit. Everything is luck, and once you ditch your pride and admit this, luck gets a lot kinder. The kind of bad shit that happens to other people just doesn't seem to touch him. And there's always a cab waiting for him when he needs one. So long as he keeps his kick in his pocket.\n\nJackie is a punk, and frankly most everyone in town can't stand them, but they get the idea: The body is an illusion. Every morning, they clutch their kick and repeat the mantra \u2014\u00a0I am energy. This shell only contains me, it is not me. Jackie can fucking breath fire. Oh, not out at people. Just in. But fire and smoke don't hurt 'em, and they don't really feel the weather. \n\nThat's small time stuff though. Let's timeskip five years, and see how they're doing.\n\nLaurie has really gone to town on her usual tricks. After binge watching most of the last VHS tapes the local rental place sold to her for nickles, she worked out that by ripping out bits of her dreamcatchers, she can slip the ragged bits of videotapes into people's pockets and then can send her thoughts into other people's heads. She can't mind control, but she can think thoughts for other people, who will think of them just as their own. It's about to get her in a lot of trouble.\n\nMichael's gone down a similar path. He used to think luck was just an impartial force, now he thinks 'Lady Luck' might be real, and he can ask her for favours. Put another way, he can hex people now. Mind you, karma's a bitch: Any bad luck he puts on someone else, comes back to him eventually. \n\nJackie got dead. Like I said, they were a punk. But before they went down, they'd learned to set their goddamned fists on fire and turn their skin to ice. \n\nAll of them think there's another step. (Well, except for Jackie. Dead's dead.) A way up to 'archmage' status. But if so, none of them found it.\n\nOK, but what's this kick bullshit, right? Well, magic ain't free. You need a power source. Hard to say why certain objects start humming with power, but they do. Religious artifacts are classics \u2014 Especially sentimental old ones. The cross bought off ChurchSupplies.com (Yes, that's real) ain't gonna have kick... but the one handmade by the first reverend of the church would. That chintzy Mother Mary plastic figurine has none... but this one that's been handed down three generations now does.\n\nThe logic most mages tend to ascribe is this: Kick is human emotion, thought and need accumulating into physical objects over the decades, residing there and able to be drawn on. Which means sometimes you really don't wanna know how, say, the sex toy on auction today has kick. You just don't wanna know.\n\nWhat you do wanna know is this: To do magic, you need kick. The more powerful the magic, the more kick you need. Worse, doing magic will, slowly but surely, wear out the kick on an object.\n\nHence, the need. Kick runs out. Finding more kick is essential. And for kick, you will bluff, steal, cheat, lie and smuggle.\n\nWelcome to Shreveport. We got kick.", "name": "Dirty, Filthy, No-Good Magic Trash"}

Her family were a bunch of Rebel Greybacks. Though I grew up in these Confederate swamps, I wear the blue coat of a proud Union soldier. I'm a traitorous rascal fighting against my own breed. My brothers in arms are card sharps, reprobates, drunkards, deserters from the rebel cause and hell, maybe this one too. We know every bend of this swampy, snake-infested hellhole. We drink this stagnant tea colored water like its bourbon and we stamp out Johnny Reb just like we was swatting mosquitoes. It takes an odd fellow to thrive out here in the Pocosins. I guess that makes us a whole company of odd fellows.\u201d*\n\nThis is the story of four desperate and depraved Union soldiers abandoned behind enemy lines in the swamps they once called home. They've done unspeakable things on their raid deep into the North Carolina Pocosins. We play to find out how they will pay for their misdeeds. The spirits of the swamp do not forget. No one may pass untested.\n\n**Game Mechanics**\n\nThis will be a short game consisting of a prologue, and three to four scenes. In the prologue, each character will have the opportunity to recount their offenses and interactions during Potter's Raid through a series of vignettes. \nThe remainder of the game will then focus on the difficult escape back to Union-held New Bern. Roughly one character will die during each scene, joining the ranks of the vengeful Swamp Ghosts.\n\nAs a Swamp Ghost, The player's character becomes a restless spirit following the remaining survivors. Their goals are to compel the survivors to reflect on the horrors and atrocities of their past and to guide the living towards an untimely demise. Swamp Ghosts may impart their strengths and weaknesses on any living character by playing cards on a challenge. They may speak to any character, providing information which is sensed as an intuition or a faint whisper on the wind. They may raise the stakes in a scene by narrating additional complications in line with their character\u2019s misdeeds and demise. For example, if your character was a robber who drowned in the swamp, your swamp ghost can complicate scenes by introducing an element of money, water, greed, suffocation, etc.\n\n**Characters**\n\nThe four players will be soldiers from the First North Carolina Cavalry who took part in Potter\u2019s Raid. They will each have a horse and a rank of either Lieutenant, Sergeant, Corporal, Private or Bugler. Though they are natives of the Confederate state of North Carolina, they are Union loyalists. Soldiers like these are rough around the edges. They are willing to kill their childhood friends, loot their neighbor\u2019s homes and set fire to their own town halls. This personality is not a requirement, but your character fights with these men and women and is cut from a similar cloth.\n\n**Tone and Content**\n\nThis story aims to emulate a grim southern gothic tale filled with moral ambiguity and sinister events stemming from poverty, alienation, crime and violence. Though focused on the American Civil War, this game will not aim to be historically accurate and won't require prior knowledge of historical events.

They live in the Church of Saint-Antoine with Mother Colette, a nun who took them in and raised them. She is an old woman who usually turns a blind eye to their capers, but one day she asks for their help in retrieving a certain painting before she leaves this world for good. Her children are more than happy to help her retrieve what is lost, but it lands them into a sticky web of political scheming and upheaval.\n\n\u2022 This game will take place in a Historical France-inspired fantasy world with characters and events based loosely off of the Romantic era and novels (mostly *The Three Musketeers*). It is also inspired by *The Lies of Locke Lamora* by Scott Lynch (if you are not familiar with either of the novels, or the Romantic era & works, still feel free to apply! I'm not trying to be too much like them.)\n\u2022 There won't be any magic or mythical creatures, but more of an occult theme featuring alchemy and possibly ghosts & spirits.\n\n**Characters**\n\nI am looking for people to fill roles for the three main characters. I'm leaving it up to you to decide who they will be, but here's a few guidelines:\n\n(Feel free to change up the strength/weaknesses/subplots)\n\n\u2022 **The Brains**: the first one to be taken it by Mother Colette. They were originally going to take over her role in the clergy, so they are well-versed in scripture and the Classical languages. But as they grew older, they lost interest in taking up the cloth, but not their thirst for knowledge. They often sneak into the Royal Library for advanced and hidden knowledge.\n\n\u2022 **The Charmer**: They are very conscientious about their appearance and they are *very* good at acting and mimicry. They often frequent *La Brasserie Acacia* for their beer and atmosphere. \n\n\u2022 **The Doer**: They always like to be doing something and they don't sit still. Can be a bit of a maverick. They like to frequent a brothel called *La Petite Mort* to fulfill their odd kinks.\n\nTo keep with the French theme, they need a French-ish name! They're not blood-related, so surnames can be different. Here are some sites I like to use:\n\nhttp://www.behindthename.com/names/usage/french\n\nhttp://surnames.behindthename.com/names/usage/french\n\n**Tone**\n\nI'm going for a mostly light-hearted tone with plenty of banter. There will be serious moments, but I'm sure you'll be able to tell what is what.\n\n\n**The Game**\n\nI'm a first time narrator, and still trying to get my bearings in Storium, so if you're super *super* serious, I might let you down. I set the expectations to casual, since I'm very busy with work and might not always have the energy to post. I can promise I won't go more than 3 days without posting (unless otherwise stated) I also do not expect players to be sitting there refreshing the page in anticipation, but to try and keep a steady post-flow so interest won't be lost (hopefully).

It seemed like this was the deep breath before the likely plunge back into war, with Berlin at the epicenter of a war between superpowers of the United States (NATO) and Russia (The Warsaw Pact), both sides now armed with nuclear weapons, high levels of military technology and hundreds of thousands of troops.\n\nConfrontation between the superpowers evolved (or devolved) into agents and assets operating in and around Berlin, looking for clues about their opponents next moves, secret devices or methods of gaining the upper hand. Beneath all of this was the underlying remnant of the supernatural; witchcraft, changelings, vampires, werewolves, ghouls, superstition and enchantment.\n\nInto this mix, the NATO allies recruited, extorted, bribed or leveraged special individuals as agents to counter the indication that the Warsaw Pact had assets in place already. It is up to the British Commonwealth, French or American agents to discover and foil any malevolent activities from the other side of the Iron Curtain.\n\n\n\nI expect this to be a short piece - no more than 5 chapters of a couple of scenes each. There is a definite conclusion but how - or whether it is reached depends largely on the choices made. I prefer third person past tense but whatever is comfortable - after all, the play\u2019s the thing. The inspiration is Lovecraft and Le Carre. Resources include history, Call of Cthulhu/Trail of Cthulhu and Cold City.\n\nI would like realistic character pics and character sketches relative to the time period of about 1960. Same for creating your own nature, subplot, strengths and weaknesses. I expect to accept no more than four players and am more interested in quality and intent to see the story to completion than first comers. There are some players that I know and know me who I expect to accept without pause; I would like players who already have a track record of good play and coherent narrative but will consider new players with a compelling character.\n\nThe characters are fairly normal people thrust into an abnormal situation, no superpower players, cosmic monsters or gods. I expect players to write only for themselves unless there is a discussion between players and agreement made. NPCs may largely be managed by players with some exceptions so revisions may be asked for. Players are welcome to add flavor and color including zero card moves.\n\nThe tone will be gritty and dark but should remain generally safe for work.\n\nI can be reached (and response expected shortly) at Talionis@live.com or through private messaging. I am in the U.S., Mountain time. I get that real life happens, so if you\u2019re going to be offline for more than a day or so let me know and I\u2019ll keep things moving.

Your character is going to die in this one. No ifs ands or buts. \n\nAs designer Stephen Dewey wrote: \n\n_\"The middle of a sunless apocalypse. The sky has darkened  and turned against you. Satellites have gone quiet, leaving  you without solar power, cell phones, internet, GPS, and many other luxuries that the world has grown accustomed to. Power grids have failed on a global scale against the demand and the world has been left in darkness. And now, They have come. It is uncertain what They are, but  They\u2019re out there in the dark, and They\u2019re coming for you.\"_\n\n_Ten Candles is not a game about \"winning\" or beating the monsters. Instead, it is a game about what happens in the dark and about those who try to survive within it. It is a game about being pushed to the brink of madness and despair, searching for hope in a hopeless world and trying to do something meaningful with your final few hours left._\n\nIf you have any inclination that you want to contradict this, or propose a way that your character can survive, don't.

No one quite reckons exactly what life was like before The Reckoning, only that the world was a sinful place. Thus, the Lord cast down his fire and brimstone and scourged the world of wickedness. That was a sight over 300 years ago, according to The Book of Jonah, the bible written by the Prophet Jonah. It was Jonah who brought light to the darkness and courage to those afraid. Jonah formed the Church of Angelic Salvation - and all those who \"walked in the light\", who were touched by the Lord, bore his mark. Some might call them mutants, but good folk, righteous folk, call them blessed. \n\nThe world after the reckoning is a changin'. Strange creatures roam the land and no one knows quite fer sure what's out yonder. Sure, there's some who done ventured out and most ain't never returned. And those that did...well, they had strange tales to tell. Tales of fearsome monsters and strange and exotic contraptions. Some whisper that things ain't quite what they seem, or that Reverend Elias Grimm, Liberty's moral leader and head of the Church of Angelic Salvation is hidin' something. \n\nMost folk here, whether members of the flock or not, have one or more mutations. Normies send their kids to Camp Crossroads for their baptism when they turn 12 (and even then, they are usually the subject of gossip or stigma) or seek to pilgrimage to those spots of the Lord's light where they can be \"touched by the light\" themselves.

They invented machines that ruled the land, air and sea; they created electronic and mechanical aids for every task, no matter how menial; they bent nature to their will in every part of the globe; and they burned the resources of the world with no concern for the future.\n\nWhen the reality of their situation sank in, it was too late. Oil reserves dwindled, coal seams ran out, forests were depleted, and the water began to rise. Before the first bombs fell it was too late, but that didn't stop the super powers. Wars raged, brief but intense, as the world powers battled over the last few scraps of cheap energy. When the wars ended, no nation was left standing. Those with the money and foresight to hoard resources, build shelters and ride out the storm escaped relatively unscathed. Most of the rest of the population was reduced to scavenging the flooded coasts or scorched plains in order to survive.\n\nNow, the Fall is a distant memory. A handful of super-rich live in enclaves in the temperate climes near the arctic circle, while most of the world slaves away under their yoke. There are places, though. Wild places. Places where even the corporations fear to go.

I really like the world and the writing in the other instances of this game was exciting and interesting. Hoping to actually finish this time :D. *\n\nThis story is inspired by the works of Paulo Bacigalupi, particularly *The Drowned Cities*, *Ship Breaker*, and  *The Windup Girl*, as well as post-apocalyptic films and stories. Familiarity with Bacigalupi's works is in no way necessary (but I'd suggest you check them out if you get a chance, because they are incredible). This is a low-tech future setting. There are some advancements, but they mostly have to do with genetic engineering and harnessing natural resources (wind/solar); they are also almost exclusively owned by the super rich. Players should expect to be using modified versions of simple current era weapons, walking most places, or paying extravagant fees for motorized transport. \n\nI'm looking for 2-4 players with a range of Natures and configurations.

JOIN THE ARENA AND WIN RICHES BEYOND YOUR WILDEST DREAMS!\n\nHowever, the crier conveniently forgets to mention the blood, gore and high chance of losing your life.\n\n*This game is a simple concept, but I am sure it will be enjoyable. It is an anything-goes, free-for-all player-vs-player arena. Your character can be absolutely anything, I will still accept it. When you are accepted, you are immediately put into battle against the other players. Act fast, or you may be killed. Each player has a 1 point challenge card representing them. If your challenge is fulfilled, you are dead. Dead players cannot move and will be removed from the game. You may make another if it is possible. I do not know. When you kill a player, the 3 outcomes represent how tired you are after a murder. Strong allows you to keep on playing, uncertain requires you to wait for one other move before playing again, and weak requires 2 moves. You win control of the story even if you complete the challenge uncertainly btw. Each \"round\", 5 players are accepted and sent to battle. Win the round by being the last man standing. Win 3 rounds with the same character and you win.*\n\n*One thing you should remember is this: this game is all about working fast. You have to kill everyone else before they kill you. New \"rounds\" will start at random times, so as to make it fair for everyone. You CAN make truces, but those have to be made in a move. If you make a truce in a move, the player you made it with must agree. They cannot go back on that agreement.

That\u2019s why all the beds were moved.\u2019\n\u2018Yes, I know!\u2019 Dinah replied, more irritated than before. \u2018It\u2019s just that it\u2019s always been us, just us, for so long\u2026 how can she even begin to imagine bringing *grown men* into this place?\u2019\nDuncan looked over at the collection of children. \nThey were all shapes and sizes, from the smallest, Christina, who all the girls called \u201cKissy\u201d, a child who was barely old enough to speak clearly and was currently balanced on the hip of another older girl, looking out at the bus that was arriving, all the way up to Duncan himself, who was now nearly nineteen. He even remembered some of the older ones who had been there when he was smaller, when he had arrived at Miss Brinley\u2019s Institute for Children. Once they were adults, many chose to leave, and it seemed that Miss Brinley would never stop them, though Duncan often wondered what became of those poor souls. \n\n\u2018But they\u2019re not just *any* men,\u2019 he continued, remembering what they had all been told when they had been gathered into the large room Miss Brinley used for assemblies. There were only twenty-three children in the place, and they all sat in rows according to their size, neatly. \n\u2018They are war heroes, brave men who have suffered greatly in the horror of war. We owe them our freedom and our thanks,\u2019 he parroted back to Dinah and she sighed, clearly not sure about any of it.\n\u2018But what\u2019s that got to do with *us*?\u2019 she said, \u2018I know the war was horrible, I know that lots of people died, but\u2026 that doesn\u2019t mean we should turn into some sort of veteran\u2019s hospital. Does it?\u2019\n\u2018But they\u2019re not ordinary veterans,\u2019 Duncan replied, quietly...\n\nThe children were a buzz, long after the bus had pulled away, empty of its passengers. They sat around the recreation room and no one played games or talked of anything else. They were crouched in twos and threes, like birds on wires, chattering and fidgeting. It was well over an hour before the door finally opened and Miss Brinley entered. \nShe was a woman of a certain age, a woman who should have long ago been married with children of her own and yet was quite unexpectedly unwed. Her institution was a one of a kind and the knowledge of that burned brightly in her green eyes when she looked around the world that she had created for those who could never live elsewhere. She was a fierce creature, unafraid in the face of things that would make greater creatures shrink in fear. Her entrance to the room was accompanied by her raising her still gloved hands. She had been outside, her face was ruddy from the wind and she tried to quell the tide of excitable small people as she reached up to pull the pin from her hat and remove it. \n\n'Yes,' she said, 'They're here.'\n\n***************************************************************\n\nThere is a house, an institute, where children who have been \u201csupernaturally disturbed\u201d are sent when their families are unable to care for them. Begun in 1890 by  Miss Brinley, a scholarly and intelligent spinster of some means. \n\nThe house has a collection of children who have all had some kind of run in with the supernatural with which their families are unable or unwilling to handle. They have any number of difficulties, including but not limited to- Haunted by ghosts, taken by fairies and returned, possessed, under the thrall of a vampire, infected with werewolf blood, possessing \u201cpowers\u201d pyrokinesis and so on, children of spirits or some kind of supernatural affair\u2026  \n\nAfter WW1-(1919) there is an influx of a new group of people, no longer only children. The house fills one of the wings with young men returned from the front with stories and scars of a different kind. \n\nThere are men who have seen ghosts of their comrades, seen horrific monsters feeding on the dead, ghouls and cult activity. These men have found themselves either sent to asylums or having to completely hide their experiences, something which has posed difficult. These men are unable to continue with the scars they bear in a society that might accuse them of madness, cowardice or both. \n\n**EDIT- The Soldiers do not have to have any supernatural powers at all.

On the dark of the moon, you pray that the fog isn't too bad and the swell isn't running and you run out over Jersey Reef into the open Atlantic, where Aveline's mothership, the *Bucephalus*, is slowly circling in international waters just beyond the 12-mile Rum Line. You load booze -- Canadian whiskey, Bermudan rum, whatever Mike's got -- until your gunwales are just inches above the oily swells. \n\nYou come back in, repeating the same prayers at the shoals, and in recent months you add a new prayer: that the fog be a *little* thicker, to hide your boat from the eyes of Carl Elliott and his revenue cutters. Aveline had bought off the old Coast Guard crews, but Elliott has brought in his own team, so virtuous they're called the \"Unsinkables.\" They'll confiscate your cargo, take your boat, throw you in jail, and when you get out Aveline's men will greet you at the prison gate, telling you how it is that you're going to pay Aveline for the cost of that lost cargo. Iron Mike doesn't care that your boat and livelihood are lost. \n\nBut Fall is a time of change. \"Diamond Jake\" Jefferson, the playboy gangster whose parties are the toast and the scandal of Newport, is moving North and he's doing it in the most ostentatious way possible: literally cruising into Miskatonic Harbor.\n\n---\n## The Docks at Beverly \n\nThe  docks at Beverly smell of tar, fish, and seagull shit. A week of hoses and deck brushes have reduced the stink, but not even Diamond Jake's money can buy away the smell of a New England fishing town, a homely reek that testifies to traditions of honest, back-breaking, dangerous work. He can only distract the marks with gilt and flash, a brass band playing, and more bunting than the Fourth of July. \n\nThe distraction works. The *Miranda*, Diamond Jake's floating mansion, sits alongside the docks, her brightwork sparkling in the perfect light of an Indian Summer afternoon. Velvet ropes close the two gangways while monstrous tuxedoed bouncers -- spectacles in their own right -- scan the crowd. The dock is packed with party-goers unwise enough to have arrived at the long-past time specified for boarding. Crew, workers, and late-arriving supplies have no chance of making it through the throng and are being ferried over from other docks, scrambling up onto the fandeck and being hurried to their stations.\n\nOf course, if the *Miranda* looks out of place in the afternoon sun of Beverly, just imagine the scene when she ties up on Water Street in Arkham tonight, some time long after midnight. And before that? A hell of a party.\n\n--- \n\nAt least the first act of this story will take place at an extravagant party on board the *Miranda* as it makes its leisurely way from Beverly to Arkham. Diamond Jake Jefferson is making his entrance to the Miskatonic Valley in the most extravagant way possible. Of course, he's been laying the groundwork for this move for months and the guest list includes the political and society elite -- judges and aldermen, intellectuals and artists, ministers and Masons. (Well, not \"Masons,\" so much. Apparently there are some other fraternal societies that hold more sway in Essex County.) \n\nDiamond Jake's parties are famously scandalous and there will also be athletes, famous actors (probably from the stages of Boston or New York, but who knows?), and notorious flappers. There will be young and beautiful people, some dissipated, some ambitious, but all with the intention of making the night memorable. Mixed among the swells and the sparkling will be some working-class folk from the Miskatonic Valley: the rum runners whose fishing boats and delivery trucks are crucial to Diamond Jake's takeover. \n\nAnd, although the *Miranda*'s core crew is tightly controlled by Diamond Jake, the party will be worked by local servers and hired entertainers. The main act is the best jazz band north of New Orleans, but until they go on there will be other singers, magicians, and vaudevillians. \n\nThe first challenge of the story will simply be being on board the *Miranda* when she casts off: Who are you and why are you here? \n", "name": "Gin & Miskatonic"}

Captain Shar's orders were to clear the Solar system and engage the Trans-Warp drives to attempt the fastest transit to Vulcan as yet recorded.

At least so that you couldn't look at any two and say there'd be no contest between them.\n\n*First Scene:* The story will begin with showing where in the city each character is and what case they're currently working on in their work.

Well-written submissions along this line will be well-regarded.\n\nCharacter creation: Creating your cards is very welcome, but please make them in line with the cards that have been made. That is, your nature should reflect your mythos, and  your strength cards should *not* be your powers, but your personality.

But both sides were operating outside the law, with even heroes occasionally pursued and prosecuted. Everything changed when they took control of the world. \n\nMutants and alien half-breeds  shunned by society, magicians and shamans who heeded the call of bloodthirsty ancient civilizations, scientists and engineers who built corporations richer than most countries, martial artists and super soldiers who transcended humanity.

Her origins, as well as her tragic early demise, are aspects which vary greatly depending on who you ask.  She is however always the hero in every story, some even endow her with great powers and abilities.

Lincoln Osiris\n>(Tropic Thunder, 2008)\n\n\nAct out different roles in a variety of exciting movies over the course of this Storium game about playing an actor playing a character. You are the actor. You are also the character. It's complicated...\n\n##How it Works\n(It's not THAT complicated)\n\nIn this game the character you create is an actor. That actor will have a role as part of an ensemble cast of several different movies. \n\nThe movie will go a quick 3-6 scenes, at which point we will begin a new movie, and the actor you create will be cast in a different role altogether, but still bringing their own look, personality, and quirks to that character.\n\nSo you might create Jane Doe, hopeful hollywood starlet. She might be playing the lead in a RomCom in the first scene, a Russian spy five scenes later, and an alien diplomat from the galactic core by scene 10. \n\n##How to Play It\n\nThis will require a touch of finesse. See, you play from the point of view of the role (the movie character) at all times. They should know they are in the world of the movie, be motivated carry out the story's plot, and be in the mindset of the role. They ALSO know they are an actor in a movie, have that actor's own motivations (like have a fantastic death scene, or have that oscar moment), and possibly have some fourth-wall breaking, self aware moments about what is going on.\n\nIt's a delicate balance perhaps, but should be fun to play out.\n\nAll the action should be on-screen. The director won't be calling cut to reset the scene (though it's fair game to reference the bad CGI they are using for the big monster). Any behind-the-scenes drama will play out within the movie world (for instance, that jerk may keep running over your lines, but rather than having it out in the trailer, you'll just have to under-react to his punch in your fight scene. Revenge!)\n\nI hope to keep it as cinematic as possible in the form of writing. Bias should be given to action and dialogue over inner voice, but there IS plenty of fun to be had with inner voice, or voice-over, or in rare instances straight up talking into \"the camera\".\n\nThere will be an interesting balance struck between characters completing actual plot-challenges (sway the diplomat, defeat the bad guy) as well as \"cinematic\" challenges (have a cool montage, Shyamalan twist, do an amazing stunt).\n\n\n##How it Might Feel\n\nThe experience should be a little like watching a movie marathon of the body of work of Quentin Tarantino, Martin Scorsese, Wes Anderson, or early Joss Whedon. You watch a variety of different stories told, often utilizing many of the same actors playing different characters. (plus some new faces along the way)\n\nThis more a game about WATCHING movies, rather than making them. For the players, it's about BEING IN THEM. There will be no behind the scenes stuff, though I expect there to be a lot of nods to movie tropes, things you often see in movies, and only in movies. \n\nSome references with elements we'll be looking for: *Stranger than Fiction, Last Action Hero, Scream, Deadpool, Ferris Beuller's Day Off*\n\n##The First Movie:\n\n*(Subject to change based on Open Lobby and Green Room discussion)*\nA group of friends, old and new, join a co-ed kickball league to have some fun on the weekends. The situation starts getting out of hand when an arrogant team from the fancy condo development in town challenges them to a bet they can't refuse. In this underdog comedy of self-discovery, friendships will be tested, romance explored, and a kickball championship will be hotly contested.\n\n*This is designed to be a short, simple concept to get our feet under us with the style of this game. Roles might include any of the \"friends\" in the kickball league, the coach, the opposing team, the league organizer, whatever*", "name": "In Character"}

We are glad to have you on board for the 1995 season and hope you\u2019ll make many happy memories of your own in the process of providing excellent service for our park\u2019s many visitors.\n\nYour official start date is Thursday, May 25, one week before the park opens for guests. Please bring the enclosed health forms and housing survey when you report for orientation. Please also bring a swimsuit. We have a new water slide this year and will be counting on you to help test it out!\n\nIf you have questions in the meantime, please contact me at 814-555-0944.\n\nSee you in May!\n\nBrad Summers\n\nStaff Coordinator\n\nSummerland Adventure Park\n\n**~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**\n\nSummerland was founded in the late 1960\u2019s by the late Gerald Summers, a billionaire hoping to recreate some of the magic of his childhood summers visiting Coney Island.  He felt that Disney and the other mega-parks were too corporate, too profit-driven. He wanted a place for families to make memories that went beyond the merchandizing.\n\nThe park is nestled in the hills of rural Pennsylvania and features several water rides, a wooden roller coaster, an theater for outdoor concerts, and the usual odds and ends of boardwalk games and other family attractions.  There\u2019s also a restaurant on site with a beer garden.\n\nBecause the park is in a remote area, on-site housing is available for employees of your level.  While this perk was originally intended as a money-saver for younger employees, it added a fun dimension to the work experience.  Some have described it as having a \u201csummer camp\u201d sort of feeling, which Summers fostered by hosting parties and special events throughout the season for all the employees.\n\nAnd now your Summerland adventures await!  You've gotten one of the coveted spots on the staff for the 1995 season.  Let's make it a summer to remember.\n\n========================================\n\nOOC Goodies:\n\nI envision Summerland as a fun, summer romance story. I\u2019d like for this to be a character-driven narrative, exploring relationships and the sorts of situations people get into when away from their \u201creal lives\u201d for the summer, meeting new people, and possibly reinventing or discovering themselves.\n\nAll player characters will be 20-somethings who have applied for jobs at the park.  Please feel free to make your own cards if you think of something that interests you more.  I don't mind a lot of duplication with the nature cards (you can all be college students, if you like), but I'd love to see some diversity with the other cards.\n\nAlthough I anticipate player characters pairing off, I\u2019ll have some NPC\u2019s for you to interact with (and pair with) depending on your character\u2019s interests.  I haven't planned a rigid structure, though I have some goals and events in mind to help add structure. I\u2019m open to suggestions on all these things as the story develops, too.  \n\nI\u2019ve set the story in the 1990\u2019s, so if you guys want to have fun with all the trends from that to add some flavor, go for it.  No historical accuracy is necessary.  The park is in a fairly remote, so it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019d be watching the news anyway.\n\nGiven the number of characters involved, I've marked this as slow, but please try to move every 3 days or so, minimally. (More is fine, of course!) If you need time away, just mention it in the comments.  If you're gone for more than a week without saying something, we'll write you out.  \n\nAlso, I\u2019m a first-time narrator, so I welcome feedback on my work here, as well.  :)", "name": "Summerland"}

{"id": "b61fa5b0-1412-4314-b899-2d7824d01ce7", "premise": "Since the God's creation, the world has been inhabited by a spattering of different races. Elves, Dwarves, humans, and many more. With the differences between species, came war. Most wars were over within a few years, and few raised a number of casualties worth noting. All, except for the war of the humans.\n\nWhile the much larger, northern continent of Tilor is filled with a variety of races, the southern continent of Yalin housed only humans. The humans divided themselves into two separate factions: Belguard to the West, Mandarai to the East. For 250 years, war waged on between these two nations. Neither remembered why the war began, but they continuously refused to stop for anything short of clear and utter victory.\n\nFrom an outside perspective, the two countries were an equal match. The other races of the world were willing to open trade routes, but they refused to raise arms in the name of either faction. Overtime, the expansive forest that divided the two nations served to cause a stalemate; the cavalry of Belguard were unable to maneuver a large force forward, while the archers of Mandarai feared entering the open fields of their enemy.\n\nThat was, until 12 years ago. In the year 782 A.C. (After Calamity), something terrible happened. Within the capital city of Mandarai, a portal to another world - or many worlds - opened. From its depths rose strange and powerful creatures - some intelligent, some not. The creatures - monsters, as they are now called - poured forth, turning Mandarai from one of the most powerful nations in the world, to a dark, overrun husk of its former self.\n\nThe few that survived were those of the Mandarai who fled first. Word traveled to Belguard, and it appeared as if it were up to Mandarai's timeless enemy to contain the disaster that were bursting from its Kingdom. Unfortunately, Belguard refused to act.\n\nPrince Mandric of Belguard - 22 at the time - was third in line to the throne. While his father and elder brothers bickered about the shame of helping an enemy, Mandric hired a mercenary company and struck out for Mandarai. While his force was not large enough to strike at the heart of the problem, he managed to set up an outpost in the forest of the Belguard-Mandarai border. While others would sit back and watch, Mandric and his men made it their duty to control - and destroy - these new creatures.\n\nIt is now the year 794 A.C., twelve years after the opening of the portal. Monsters have spread across the planet, but the majority of the creatures still reside within Mandarai. As far as the world knows, the portal remains open - possibly driving the creatures to remain nearby. Likewise, Mandric and his mercenary force remain strong. \n\nOver time, many individuals of all races and nations have joined Mandric's Guild. They are funded by merchants and King's looking to use the hides, claws, and organs of the beasts as components for new and diverse crafts. Mandric's Monster Slaying Mercenaries have become a successful business, known by all.\n\nBut, no matter how many hunter's Mandric's Guild recruits, they still hold true to two goals: they are the first line of defense for the world and, one day, they will find a way to close the portal.\n\n--------------------------------------\n**Out of Character Information**\n\nHelllllllllllllllllllllllllllllloooooo! I've narrated a few stories in my time, so I have a fair amount of experience and an idea of where I want to go with this. As the players, you will be Mercenaries with the express purpose of hunting and killing monsters. These could range from anything to dragons, vampires, giant ants, demons, or whatever my imagination can come up with!\n\nStorium is pretty focused on collaborative writing, but I enjoy firm control of my npc's and have plenty of good  idea's for plot development. Much of the action, however, will likely be up to your control. I want you to have fun, but I want to tell a story, too, ya know?\n\nEach chapter will likely be a mission. Player characters don't have to travel together, and there will be a list (like a bulletin board) of potential assignments, as well as a load of npc's that you could choose to travel/work with.\n\nI would like the story to be in third person past, but I understand slip ups (writing in both across multiple stories gets me screwed up too, and, sometimes, this feels like dnd, heh). I would like to aim for completing 2 scenes in a week, but, as I've seen across Storium, it seems likely that we'll be traveling a bit slower than that, which is okay.\n\nIf players need to drop, no worries, because this is designed for a pretty open give-and-go environment, since the Mercenary Guild is so populated.\n\n**Character creation guidelines**\n\n*Races* - Confirmed races of the world are Dwarves, Elves, Halflings, Hawk-men, and Humans. I'm open to other suggestions. The northern continent is open for you to create races/histories all you want, as I've only severely focused on developing the southern, human continent.\n\n*Magic* - I'm open to discussion about types of magic. The only thing I'm holding solid on is this - magic is done through mental energy in the same way that you use physical energy to move your body. The more magic energy used, the more your mind starts to turn into a drunken state, until you eventually black out. Also similar to physical endurance, extensive practice allows one to build up their mental endurance, allowing greater feats of magical strength without turning drunk/passing out.\n\nIt should be noted that the majority of the mercenaries in Mandric's guild use enhancement magic. Example - a warrior may use strength and endurance magic so that they can withstand the direct strike of a dragon's tail without dying. Likewise, an archer might use speed and eye-sight enhancement magic, ect.\n\n*Natures, Strengths/Weakness* -Please create your own. Make natures your specialty, not your race (Ex: Archer). If you're an archer, Strength doesn't need to be something obvious... if you're an archer, you're good with bows. So make it something else like a quick thinker, or a positive person, or smooth talker, ect. Same with weakness. Sub-plots can be anything, and I'll make it work. (If you have difficulty with these, feel free to email me and I'll send you/put up a few choices, but I would like you to create your own.)\n\nYour characters can be new to the Guild, or they could be veterans - even as far back as being an original member. If you're a veteran of the guild, though, I'd like you to have an idea of how many assignments your character has completed. I would guess that the average would be about 1 per month, due to travel time/healing time, ect. (I'd like it if you included that in your biography, so we can all see how experienced your character is).\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to email me at drgnicefire@gmail.com, or go to https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/t341er and ask your questions there!", "name": "Mandric's Monster Slaying Mercenaries"}

Some bunnies were nearly the size of people. Some resembled actual bunnies. They were very, very old bunnies. You might call them geriatric.\n\nNearby farmers ignored the castle. It was a protected landmark from the days of feudalism. They farmed their fields diligently and only admired the castle from afar as they planted genetically modified corn and wheat, creating vast fields of monocultured frankenfood. Viruses preyed on the plants as viruses will... hijacking the genetic material of the flora in order to reproduce and changing themselves and the plants in the process...

I will also open a forum post [HERE](https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/8zch7g) to answer questions that way, and so existing players can chime in.\n\nThank you very much, and we look forward to writing with you!\n\nGusR\nNew World Corp. (previously Planetfall, Inc.)\n\n\n#*The Story:*\n\nIn 2093 Dr. Thomas Canter perfected what would later be called the Origami Drive.  Able to manipulate the fabric of space, it finally delivered the stars to humanity.  In only a few short years a kind of gold rush developed, with the inhabitants of an overcrowded Earth flocking to new worlds for either a chance at a better life, or simply through a sense of adventure.\n\nPreoccupied with economic collapse and widespread conflict, the various governing bodies of Earth were unable to keep up with the rapidly developing industry of colonization.  Dozens of companies rose and fell in a field almost devoid of meaningful regulation.  Some groups, such as New World Corp, developed a pristine reputation for not only transportation, but also for the support of their growing colonies, or Outposts as they came to be known.  These companies would recruit the best, brightest, and richest from Earth and cultivate a settlement as it developed into an economic powerhouse in its own right.  Other, more affordable firms took a seeding approach, accepting anyone with cash and dropping them in pre-fab, barebones dropships.  Dozens of these smaller Outposts could be scattered over the surface of any planet deemed 'habitable' and then left to fend for themselves.\n\nYou're one such aspiring colonist from the latter category.  Anything could have drawn you to pick up stakes and move half a galaxy away, with little-to-no hope of ever returning to Earth.  You've packed what few bags were allotted by Planetfall Inc., and said your goodbyes to friends and family left behind.\n\n***\n\nIt's been over three months since you launched.  With the Origami Drive unable to function properly near large gravitational bodies, the outpost transport ship burned away from Earth and into the void beyond its influence.  You jumped then, and can still feel the terror of the countdown that led up to the actual event.  One second you were only a few light minutes from home - the next, you were thousands of light years further.\n\nIt's been another five and a half weeks since the jump, but you've finally made it.  There's a feed of your new home on the few view screens lining the bulkhead of your dropship, and what was once a faint dot has grown.  Shades of blue and beige.  A recorded voice rings through the intercom system, ordering all passengers to secure belongings and strap into harnesses.  A shudder runs through the hull, heralded by a definitive *chunk*.  There's a feeling of acceleration, and you realize that you've been released from the transport ship.  The final descent to the planet's surface, your new home, has begun.\n\n#*The World:*\n\nThe planet your characters will be colonizing is officially designated as EPL 1009 c, but you and your companions have already started calling it Dellingr.  It's fairly Earth-like, as these things go, at about 85% of Earth's gravity.  The atmosphere is breathable, but a higher percentage of argon makes it slightly denser than Earth's.  With a weaker than average magnetic field, protection against solar radiation is a real concern.\n\nLike all explored worlds, there have been no lifeforms discovered more complex than lichens.  Something akin to cyanobacteria populate the oceans and other bodies of water, providing just enough oxygen to support an average human at sea level without breathing devices.\n\nThe site designated as Outpost 37 is located in in a geologically promising area on the coast of the southern hemisphere's primary continent.  Flatlands extend 10 kilometers inland, and are broken by a moderate mountain range running the length of the coast.  Orbital surveys hint at a possible network of caves honeycombing the area. \n\nDays last just over 30 hours, and the orbital period is 312 local days.\n\n#*A Note on Pacing, Tone, and Mechanics:*\n\nThe pacing is set to slow, but X scenes/week isn't always accurate.  To be more specific, I'd like players who will commit to contributing once every other day or so, even if it's just a short post or a comment.  I'll try to move things along at a consistent pace with continuations if a scene lags.\n\nPlease write in the third person, past tense.\n\nI've always been fine with other players taking control of my characters during a scene (as long as it fits with their existing personality), but realize that not everyone shares that feeling.  If you'd like to use another player's character in your scene, please hash it out in the comments first.  Player death is a possibility, but only with permission (although injuries will certainly happen if a player's move merits it).\n\nAs far as the tone of the story is concerned, I'd like this to lean toward hard science fiction (as cool as they are, no lightsabers please!), but am far more interested in having a fun story than being a stickler for reality.  I want this to be an entertaining, near-future adventure.\n\nFor example, bio implants aren\u2019t rare, but many people either can\u2019t afford them or choose not to use them.  Security personnel and soldier types tend to use handheld Gauss rifles or traditional projectile weapons.  While far more advanced than our own devices, true AI has not been developed - computers and autonomous drones still require some human input and oversight.  The Expanse Series, by James S. A. Corey is a good estimation of what I'm going for.\n\nI'm okay with violence and language in this story, but other NSFW scenes are fade-to-black.\n\nFinally, I'm a first-time narrator and am looking forward to my first story!  While I have a general story arc in mind, I'm certainly open to changing course if that's the direction the game takes.\n\n\n#*A Note on Character Creation:*\n\nI'm looking for a cast of 3 - 5 players, with 5 being the absolute maximum.  In your characters, please try to develop an interesting, evocative bio.  It doesn't have to be 1,000 words or over the top, but should give a good idea of their motivations and personality.  Invitations will stay open for at least a week (assuming I get applicants, of course).\n\nPlease feel free to either use what I've provided or make up your own Natures, Strengths, Weaknesses, and Subplots - the ones I've included are just ideas.  Artwork is appreciated, but not strictly necessary.\n\nThat about covers it.  There's a forum post [HERE](https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/s4q124) if you'd like to ask any questions or participate in worldbuilding.

Imbued with a strange  primordial force, jokingly referred to as \"magic\" during the early years (then less jokingly later on), this strange planet contained a slew of undiscovered resources, ripe for excavation. The only difficulty was that Nuldorn was already inhabited by a variety of sentient species, approaching the cusp of interstellar travel themselves.\n\nAnd so the colonization......turned to invasion.\n\nFor eight long, brutal years, the assembled races of Nuldorn fought against a technologically superior alien race intent on claiming their planet for the Human Empire. It was a fight that they would lose.\n\nYou are a Nuldornian, a member of one of the indigenous people of your planet, and a product of several generations of submission to the Human master race. Whether Gedkin, Cruz, Lirrozix or otherwise, your people are slaves, manservants, and outcasts. But there are whispers on the wind. Echoes of rebellion, murmurs of insurrection. The Humans may have chained and drained your once-proud home, but so long as even one Nuldornian draws breath, the dream of the Resistance lives on.....\n\n***NARRATOR NOTES***\n\nHello there. This will be my attempt at creating an entirely new universe, and I would like you to help build it. The story takes place on an alien planet called Nuldorn, taken over by Humans. Make no mistake, in this game we are the enemy, the conquerors, the tyrants. You cannot play as a Human, only as a Nuldornian. \n\nAs this whole story and its environs will be created from scratch, I am looking for imaginative, creative people to fill it with detail. If you wanted the chance to define both your character and the world he/she lives in, this is it. I am looking for 3-5 players who enjoy detail and depth to their stories and are willing to demonstrate this with some strong character submissions. Feel free to create locations, religions, anything you need to flesh out your character!\n\nI am a big fan of connecting images to all Storium cards, so if you want to create your own Natures, Strengths etc, please ensure you do at least this. The images for the character's themselves do not have to look EXACTLY like the example races - I appreciate these might be hard to find. If you can get a close approximation, great.\n\nThe world of Nuldorn is a grating collision of magic and technology. Magic is a nebulous essence, permeating the planet as a whole. Those who can actively wield it are uncommon, but by no means rare. Humans cannot use magic, but they make up for this with superior tech. Any of the Nuldornian races can use magic, but please do not make a godlike character - if you want to give your character big magic powers, I expect to see that same character have massive weaknesses (and I don't mean weaknesses like \"must protect the innocent\" or \"doesn't respect authority\").\n\nFinally, though the technological level of the setting is semi-distant-future, the core of the story should be focused on character development and world development, and not hung up on future-tech terminology and such.\n\nIf you're still reading by this point, then maybe you're the player for this story - have a look at the options and see what you think!", "name": "Nuldornians: The Liberation"}

The worlds nations blew into the largest and most terrifying war they had ever seen. Few alliances were formed, only hate ruled, no one could be trusted, as one nation learned dearly. \n\n The war was being won by Russia and the U.S.A, those who once bitter rivals became allies in hopes of domination. It was the year 3004, ten years after the war had begun, when Russia began to distrust even their comrade. That was the year they bombed the U.S.A, annihilating over half the country, it was just gone. Four years later every other nation pulled out, including the U.S.A, leaving Russia with the victory, and Earth.\n\nEach nation had left Earth, seeking a place safe from another war, safe from each-other. Europe in a whole went to the moon of Earth, the U.S.A. to Mars, China to Venus, and Russia claiming earth as its own. Six years passed and peace was reached on each planet as they were made habitable and colonized, only to be tortured again.\n\nUnknown beings appeared in the solar system, leaving half of the Europe colony demolished. Can the worlds come together to beat the surprising foe or will they all crumble and fall. Now, the different worlds are sending representatives to combine their strengths and beat this foe, but only one from each world, they pray they chose right.\n\n**Characters:** I want to be kind of loose about the character creations, but I can only have one from each world, so unless the powers are directly complementary, i can't let both people be of that world. 4 players maximum.\nPlease, don't make them do any kinds of supernatural things like magic, powers can come from mutations even, just not magic. This is an era of tech, not unknown powers beyond comprehension.\nYou will be working in a group to fight off foes, so if I don't get enough people, don't worry, I will play as one if necessary.

With two kings battling overseas in their struggle for power, Prince Eustace of Thyrne marches his army into enemy territory in a bold attempt to wrest the prosperous city of Attisburg out of King Heinrich's hands. Vastly outnumbered, the rival houses of Chauncey and Wyatt find themselves trapped within the walls, forced to unite their strength in the defense of the city. The tension is palpable as they struggle to hold back the enemy forces, but it is not just inside the city that rivalry brews...\n\nWill the defenders be able to hold the walls until the siege is broken, or will the city fall under the attackers' onslaught? Or will ambition and distrust make the nobles turn upon themselves before the final battle has even begun?\n\n**Details:**  \nThis is a bit of an experiemental game, to test the feasibility of a story told from multiple perspectives. It takes place in a time of war between King Valentin of Thyrne, and King Heinrich of Bassony, rulers of two fictional kingdoms in a setting largely similar to medieval Europe. The story focuses on the fighting, intrigues, and diplomacy during the siege of a Bassonian city called Attisburg, and player characters will be on both sides of the conflict.\n\nIn addition to their main characters, players will be given control of their own forces, as well as a number of minor characters. These minor characters will have their own goals and motives (and perhaps the soldiers will too...), and will not necessarily be on the same side as the player's main character.\n\nI'm more interested in a good story and roleplaying than strict adherence to game mechanics. I also encourage - and expect - players to take creative freedom in making up the details - large and small - of the world. Be bold and creative, make assumptions, and take the initiative! Player decisions will have a large impact on how the story plays out, and intrigues among players will (hopefully) be a central part of the plot.\n\n**Character creation:**  \nWith the majority of the game's original players unable to continue playing, we're now looking for new blood to see if we can breathe some life back into the game. With each player controlling multiple characters, and a relatively large game setting compared to the number of moves made, this game probably requires a greater than average effort from everyone involved, but my impression so far is that the time invested has been well worth it.\n\nIf you feel like taking on the challenge, my suggestion is that you take some time to acquaint yourself with the setting at the game webpage at https://sites.google.com/site/attisburg/ , and then either submit a new character closely tied in with the stories of the existing ones, or make a submission of one of the characters already present in the game. Except for Godfrey, Eustace and the two kings, any character not controlled by a currently active player is up for grabs if you go for the second option! If you go with the first; feel free to create your own strengths, weaknesses, and subplots \u2013 the ones provided are merely suggestions. I\u2019d prefer if you stayed with the provided natures though.\n\nIf you have questions, I'll be trying to answer them here: https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/0xedwj", "name": "The Siege of Attisburg"}

A story about modern American politics, and what happens behind the scenes of a campaign when the cameras aren't rolling.\n\n** Out of Character Information **\n\nThis game is a little bit of an experiment. The goal here is not to serve as a serious examination of the state of modern American politics or any major issues, but to use the setting of a political campaign for satire and light hearted comedy. Think *Parks and Recreation*, *Veep*, or political coverage from *The Onion* for an idea of the kind of tone I'm going for. Expect constant mishaps and overblown 'gaffes' and 'scandals'.\n\nTo the extent that any of the comedy concerns a particular party or issue, it is my intent to treat both sides with the same degree of levity.

Lodging there will be paid for, since each of you have already paid for it ahead of time since they already helped pay for your plane tickets and other things to make sure your stay here will be pleasant. This is so that you will have a wonderful time without too much of a dent in your wallet, and hopefully, to come away from this attached.\n\nThe year is the **1990's**, so cellphones, laptops, and the like are a hard find and are extremely expensive. Each of you are of normal professions and are looking for a good time. Also keep in mind the time frame for your characters regarding their professions and the years you write when making your character.\n\nBut upon your arrival, each of you already notice that something doesn't feel quite right...\n\n**Narrator's Notes**\n\n__ Players: I'm looking for maybe 2 - 5 players, and depending, more. I tried juggling a broader group of people, but it didn't last very long.\n\n__ Activity: I expect my players to be very active, or responsive. I had a few people that weren't... as such and I felt it was disappointing. It made it difficult for me to figure out what it was my players wanted and I do like to interact with you so that I know where I can take the story, if I should up the pace, or slow the pace down.\n\n__ Story: The story background generally relies on player interaction and if there isn't any there, then it would make this game rather... difficult to continue.\n\n__ Genre: Adventure, Mystery, and Horror.\n\n__ Inspiration: This is based on the *Call of Cthulhu* RPG and I've decided to give it a shot to narrate a story here on Storium.\n\n__ Character Profiles: Please include pictures with each of your character cards. I would also prefer if your character avatars/icons to be of almost \"real\" like quality, like that of either a photograph or the like. No cartoons or extremely stylized art. Realistic art, maybe CGI, is accepted.\n\n__ Writing: I expect literacy with each of my players so that it makes reading your replies easier. And this game is quite imperative to have lots of detail in your writing, please, write as much as you want! So don't skimp out on me since there is no word limits here.\n\n__ Tenses: For this game, I will ask my players to write only in third person, present tense. Any other and I will request a revision, given since this will make it feel more real.\n\n**Characters**\n\nI expect the professions to be rather normal: doctors, cops, artists, writers, athletes, businessmen, clergy, criminals, laborers, government officials, and whatever else you can think of that is present in today's day and age.\n\nPlease fill this portion out on the top of your character description:\n\nAge:\n\nHeight: (Feet / centimeters)\n\nWeight: (Pounds / Kilograms)\n\nSex: \n\nBirthplace:\n\nColleges, Degrees:\n\nMental Disorders:\n\nSanity:\n\nHealth Points: \n\nFrom there, please go here: http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dnd/dnd/20040517a and roll the d100 dice once for your Sanity and two d20's for your health points. Please be honest as I know rolling 99 is obviously cheating. Try to score for reasonable numbers on your Sanity Rolls. I'm being lenient since I want to try to modify this for Storium and once those are done, fill it in at the top. I may or may not knock it down or up, depending on your character.\n\n*Please note that the Sanity and Health Points and this game in general is highly experimental. Depending how the events of how the game goes, I may or may not get rid of it, depending on how cumbersome it might become. I might even add a few things just to give them a try whenever I come up with a new idea from the* Call of Cthulhu *RPG.*\n\n**Game Mechanics**\n\nAnything that involves losses for sanity/hp will vary depending on events and the completion of goals in the game. Go for a weak outcome, and you might end up losing a lot of sanity or hp, but go for strong outcomes, and you might just end up risking other things instead.\n\nI will keep track of these in the beginning of each scene, and will update accordingly with each progressive new piece of information. Just like the RPG, suffer a severe loss of HP of 5 or more, depending on said injury or loss, will render your character most likely unconscious for an undetermined amount of time. Suffer a certain number of Sanity loss, I will write what your character will do once that occurs and then from there, you can decide what it is your character will do.\n\nA weak outcome doesn't necessarily mean bad things will occur and a good outcome doesn't mean it's good either. I've decided to take up on an idea that will probably, or seriously, fuck up my players. 8) So prepare yourself.\n\n**Other**\n\nAnything else will be posted here for information or questions and lengthy discussions: https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/jfc3vv\n\nPlease check it frequently as I might update it with information pertaining to the story or your characters.", "name": "Vacation Gone Awry"}

If you are looking for high adventure, magic, mystery, and a fair bit of horror you have come to the right place.\n\nThank you so much for taking a minute to stop by.  FFB is played with a fresh batch of writers each chapter, and each chapter is a stand alone story with its own beginning, middle, and end.  Events do not carry from chapter to chapter so your story begins where you enter without any need to read previous writing.\n\nAt the end of each chapter, existing characters will be retired, but fear not!  As I did with FFB Vol. I, upon the completion of the entire volume all characters from all chapters will be un-retired so that ultimately you will receive a completed story in your profile (yeah!).  FFB Vol. I ran for 3 chapters and approximately 9 to 10 scenes per chapter.  I expect FFB Vol. II to be about the same.\n\nRegarding my narration style:\n\nI approach each story with a pretty rough outline of big events that will happen throughout the story as well as the big picture, but I leave the spaces in between pretty loose for you guys to be creative.   In most cases, there are some great writers who insert some stuff that makes me have to change my plan and adapt.  The story always benefits greatly from this sort of interplay.   \n\nI tend to mix some heavily controlled scenes with some looser scenes throughout each story.   For some sections, you may feel as if you are riding on rails and very limited in your choices.  Typically this occurs when I am leading to a reveal or major event.   All I can say is bear with me, as it does loosen up again.  If you have any questions about how that works, feel free to read any chapter in FFB, Vol. I as they all follow the same general mold.  (And if you do check out FFB, Vol. I, a *Favorite* would be much appreciated!  That is, of course, if you believe we earned it :P)\n\nAt times I can put real pressure on a scene with harsh/fatal consequences. Although this sounds brutal, I try to keep a balance between fun and game-like peril in the story. I feel that this has challenged some characters and made for some really great writing out of our groups, which has been awesome.   \n\nHowever, this also gives me a chance to reiterate an important point- read challenges carefully . . . characters can be seriously injured, permanently injured, and die in Fantasy for Beginners. (Mwuah ha ha ha!).  I have used this as a tool to get more development out of a character, punish Mary Sues, eliminate non-reponsive writers, and to simply tell a better story.  Again, if you have any questions, feel free to read any chapter in FFB Vol. I as examples of this happened throughout.  (Especially in Chapters 2 and 3, after I got my bearings on this narration thing.)\n\nOne final note regarding submitting characters: I receive regular comments like \u201cdoes this character look like it will work for your story?\u201d and \u201cDoes this fit what you are looking for?\u201d . . . no need to worry about this.\n\nI am looking for something mildly familiar as Fantasy - so unless you try to throw a 35 foot Gundam style robot, hard nosed gumshoe with a .45, or a 3rd generation prince from the Andromeda galaxy at me, I will probably approve the character. I don\u2019t mind if a crew is balanced or unbalance, uniform or wildly diverse, goblin, man, or beast . . . as long as you don\u2019t try to go godlike omnipotence I am ok with it.  Mary Sues and characters who show similar traits tend to run into trouble in my stories . . .\n\nSo, go ahead and write the character you would have the most fun playing and submit with complete abandon.  I have created some natures as well as goals, weak, and strong cards if needed.  You are welcome to use them or you are welcome create your own.\n\nThat is it, folks! I look forward to writing with any and all who feel like participating here!\n\nFor information on specific chapter stories, I typically post in the forum when invitations are open.  Check in the \"Looking for Group\" forum for a post that will have more details on the specific Chapter's story.  Don't expect much as I tend to employ some mystery in my stories and love to surprise the team!

Located on the Pacific Coastline west of Seattle and on the Quillayute River, Grimm Harbor is best known for its waterfalls, its lush forest, and its diverse fishing and hunting.  Originally a fishing town populated mostly by members of the Native Quilente Tribe, Grimm Harbor has recently evolved into a busy College Town and Green Information Technologies hub thanks to the work of Henry Travis, CEO of Terra-Tech Industries.  Terra-Tech Industries is a Native owned and environmentally friendly  technologies company.  Their leading products are solar roadways and glass, a technology that has benefited both the City and its newly accredited community college, Grimm Harbor University. Go Grimm Harbor Orcas!\n \nHowever, not is all as it seems in Grimm Harbor.  For ages the Quilente Tribe has stated that the forest outside the city is sacred and has a connection to the spirit world, and has fought to keep it safe from over development and deforestation.  In the last one hundred and sixty three years, the elders of the tribe have noticed an increase in mystical activity in the forest.  This increase in activity has come in the form of Changelings, wandering out of The Hedge after years of slavery at the hands of the True Fey. \n \nThe Quilente Tribe\u2019s elders, sensitive to the otherworldly nature of the Changelings, allowed these Lost to live in peace in Grimm Harbor side by side with them and white settlers.  Over the years the Changeling population has grown from a small handful to just under forty.  The Changelings came and went over the decades, but eventually the Lost population grew large enough to warrant the formation of Changeling Courts and the signing of a Freehold Pledge between them.  The Freehold of Star Cascade was formed.\n \nYou are a Changeling, a newly escaped Lost, who by luck or skill somehow escaped their Keeper and ripped themselves out of The Hedge and back into the world of mortals.  This was once your home, Grimm Harbor, before your keeper stole you away from your mortal life and enslaved you.  You\u2019ve returned to the real world, but you are different now and so is the world.  How will you survive?  How will you stay sane?  Is there any way to get your former life back?

Kiths are the sub-races of the Seemings, all Kiths are available and duel Kiths are allowed with my permission. Please let me know what you want to play ahead of time so I can make you a Nature Card.  http://www.thesubnet.com/portal/wod2/ctl/index.html is an excellent wiki for CtL and has a listing of Seemings, the Seeming Blessing and Curse, and Kiths.\n\n**Court**\n\nThe available courts are: AUTUMN, SPRING, SUMMER, and WINTER.  You may start as/or stay court-less if you so choose. \n\n**Court Mantel:**\n \nYour rank within your chosen court, it also bestows supernatural benefits as your bond with your season grants your minor gifts and interesting \u201cspecial effects\u201d.  At start of game this is zero.\n\n**Court Good Will:**\n \nYour status as a friend to a court you do not belong to.  Depending on how much you are trusted by that court depends on if they will aid you, trust your counsel, and if its nobility will teach you their court's Contracts.  At start of game this is zero.\n\n**Wyrd:**\n \nAt game start all characters will be new changelings with a Wyrd of 1.  Please review this link for an idea on how Wyrd works in table top. http://www.thesubnet.com/portal/wod2/ctl/CreationAWy.html \n\nFor the purposes of Storium, Wyrd will act as a gauge for your characters' power level.  It will give us an idea of how much Glamour your character may store in themselves, how much Glamour they can spend before they are exhausted, and how easily you should be able to resist a supernatural attack.  Please use your best judgment and play fair.  This is an honor system.  \n\n**Glamour:**\n  \nYou can back  Glamour by \u201cfeeding\u201d on emotions.  Feel free to narrate this out or not.  I will assume that when time passes, your characters have replenished themselves however it is they do.  Good description of emotional feeding however, will be rewarded.\n \nGlamour is all up to the player to relegate, if you know your character has been spending a lot of  Glamour in a scene and has not had the ability to replenish, then you should play them exhausted and on edge.  They are hungry for  Glamour and NEED it.  More over, once you feel they have used up all their  Glamour then they can no longer activate abilities or contracts that use Glamour.  Again, please use your best judgment and play fair.  This is an honor system.  \n\n**Clarity:** \n\nClarity is based on a 1-10 scale, one being bat shit cray cray psychopath and ten being on the same level as a holy Buddhist monk.  At start of game all characters *should* start at 7.\nIf your character goes down in Clarity I will assign derangements if applicable.  A derangement may come into play as Single Character challenges that distract a character from other challenges and use up their cards for a scene. For example, while the party is fighting the \u201cscary bad thing\u201d you are battling your mental issues and are too busy to lend a hand.\n\nIf your character goes up in Clarity I will give you the Asset Card: Greater Supernatural Sense.   All changeling's of clarity seven or better have a basic Supernatural Sense, it allows your character the ability to \u201csense\u201d the supernatural, including non-changelings such as Ghosts, Vampires, Mages, Werewolves, and the presence of magical energy.    The Asset Card: Greater Supernatural Sense allows your character to see past illusions, invisibility, and the tricks of Keepers. Once the card is used, it may be earned back via role playing your high Clarity or lost when your clarity goes to low. You gain the Asset Card: Greater Supernatural Sense when your character hits Clarity 10.\n \nClarity may be gained via role playing.  For more information on Clarity please see this link: http://www.thesubnet.com/portal/wod2/ctl/CreationAC.html \n\n**Contracts:** \n\nAt character creation you have access to three contracts.  One of your Seeming's Contracts, one contract from your Court, and one contract that is either a Universal, contract from your Court, or an additional Contract from your seeming.  Contracts will be represented by an Asset Card.  We will also assume that your character knows, at character creation the first two Clauses from these contracts.  Please note this, and any future learned Clauses to your character's Bio. \n\nConcerning cost, we will assume that all claused in a Contract use only Glamour, not willpower.  If Willpower is a cost, convert it to Glamour and narrate your character \u201cwilling the contracts clause to work\u201d or \u201cbelieving really hard in the clauses power\u201d.  Keep in mind Glamour cost and the toll depleting Glamour will take on your character.  If there is a cost to something we don\u2019t understand via Storium we will come to an agreement OOC and then narrate the outcome.  Catches are encouraged.  \n\nWith role playing and game play, other contracts may be opened up to your character.  Goblin Contracts may not be taken at character creation, but may be found or bought via game-play.\n\n/ / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /\n\nFor the most part I want this to be about your character's story and the plot they have gotten involved in.  The rules are there to just give us some framework to play with and make the story fit in the Changeling the Lost world.  At the end of the day, I trust you to write fair and balanced outcomes to situations, and if you ever need help or advice on how a move can fit the CoL world, please ask me.  :-)", "name": "Grimm Harbor: DayDreams"}

You're not sure what, but you dread getting out bed.\n\nYou have to, though. It's a huge day for Castle High School, the high school you attend. It's Spirit Day, the annual expression of school pride that infects the majority of the school and even the local citizens. That night is the Homecoming Football Game, played against arch rivals Valley High, followed by the Homecoming Dance. \n\nEven if you don't ascribe to the rituals of high school, you still have to go and get an education. \n\n-\n\nThroughout the morning, that weird feeling lingers. It even gets stronger. Little things go wrong. You dribble toothpaste on your shirt, your coffee is cold despite just making it, your car refuses to start. Your cell phone keeps freaking out. \n\nIt's a weird morning and it's only going to get worse. You realize that when you get to school and instead of your normal, boring high school, you're faced with a castle.\n\nAnd there's no escape. \n\nooOOooOOoo\n\nThis is a high school-set game, with fairytale and urban fantasy elements. It has the potential to turn somewhat dark, but I'm not looking for heaps of angst. There will be some horror elements (things chasing PCs, creepy things going on just out of their view, etc.). I'm a big supporter of romance and explorations of sexuality, so there's a possibility those elements will come up. It's set in a small town in a rural area of Northern California (close enough to San Francisco that it's possible to visit in a day, but not so close that it's a trip made all the time). \n\nI like diversity, I like art on the cards, and I like bios that give me a sense of the character and your writing style. Not required, but consider adding something to the bio that reflects that Friday morning - how did they handle that weird feeling?\n\nWhile the Nature cards use common princess tropes, the characters can be either gender. Natures with more than one possibility should be edited to reflect the character better, and you are not restricted to these Natures, Strengths, Weaknesses, or Subplots. (If you do create your own Nature, please keep it in line with the other Natures and it must reflect a fairytale-like theme.) Please keep characters between 16 and 18. \n\nooOOooOOoo\nCurrently looking for one more character, male character preferred. \n\n**Number of players: ** 4 - 6, depending.

Throughout the Pacific, Japanese strongholds that had been bypassed in Nimitz's \"island hopping\" campaign had remained untouched.  No longer capable of being supplied by land or sea, the Allies had simply allowed them to wither.  In the weeks after VJ Day, small naval task forces combed the Pacific, landing on bypassed islands and urging the Japanese holdouts to come out of their caves and be repatriated with their homeland.\n\nThere was some resistance.  Some Japanese, their hearts still alive with the *bushido* spirit, would refuse to surrender, and would remain in the jungles for decades to come.\n\nThere was one island in the Marshalls, however, where the Marines were greeted by their former enemies with a mixture of terror and joy.

I do use cards, but for me the story is more important.\n\nThat means that limited control of other player's characters is okay (e.g. for dialogue). Please don't do anything drastic without asking first, and I encourage players to collaborate on moves.\n\nIf I or another player does something with your character that you feel is significantly out of character, please let me know right away and I'll put in a revision request.\n\nI hope, however, that we can treat this like an improv sketch, and try to keep revisions to a minimum. Let's try to build off each other, not contradict.\n\n**Game Structure**\n\nI intend this game to be heavily episodic. What does this mean? It means that each chapter will have a handful of scenes in it that, together, tell a cohesive story. The next chapter will be an entirely different mission/event/etc.\n\nThis allows for people to easily drop in and out as real life allows, and lets me accept a large cast, as not everyone has to participate in every chapter.\n\nHaving said that, please please *please* communicate! I totally get that real life gets in the way of online funtimes, but if you have to drop out in the middle of an episode (vacation, whatever) please just let me know. I promise I won't be mad.\n\n**Collaboration**\n\nI encourage players to collaborate on their moves. I encourage players to build off the wordbuilidng outline I've given you -- make stuff up! If you're worried about it not fitting, run it by me first. You can add stuff to the google document. I also encourage players to suggest plots for episodes.\n\nI am *not* going to be enabling rotating narration for this game; currently the only option for rotating narration is every scene and I don't feel that will work with this setup. If it ever becomes an option to switch every chapter/every X number of scenes, then I may give it a shot.\n\n**Character Creation**\n\nPlease read the worldbuilding notes before making a character.\n\n**Please choose one of the Nature cards provided.**\n\nFor the rest, I have made some cards as examples/idea sparkers, but I am happy for players to make up their own so long as they are consistent with the established worldbuilding.\n\nAvatars are strongly preferred.\n\nPlease leave the name of your dragon and a short description (color, personality) in the character commentary.

The huge blue tunnel of light began to clear, and there they saw themselves through the portal, celebrating and dancing with delight. The team looked through at the clock in the future world... Yes! It was 6 minutes and 4 seconds ahead! They had created a portal to the future and there was their future selves celebrating the success! \n\nThe jubilant scientists began dancing and jumping themselves, clapping and cheering, and generally behaving like children who have had too many sweets.

Dr Fentz took the entire skinny decaf latte full in the chest and stood dripping froth and coffee. The room went quiet.

His future self was stood just as before, conspicuously not dripping any form of beverage, decaffeinated or otherwise. An event had taken place on one side and not on the other.

All have their time to go, and mine came as an old friend. \n\nIf you are reading this letter, you may congratulate yourself, as it means that before my death, I determined that you were important to me in life. \nThere are not many of you. I was a secretive woman it is true. \n\nBe you relative, in-law, business partner or friend, you all have something in common that I have observed: you are undoubtedly fond of money.\n\nDo not object, for I know you all too well. I can tell, for instance, you wonder already about the matter of my last will and testament. \n\nAs you, and I imagine much of London knows, over my many years I had accumulated much wealth. In death I have no humility to deny it, my home abounds with riches an treasure of untold value. Collections from the furthest reaches of the earth lie yet undiscovered in the bowels of my manor house in town. Collections I have no doubt you would bend over backwards to get hold of. \n\nAnd therein lies the meaning of this invitation. For indeed it is an invitation. For lack of a decent lawyer with whom I have ever shared a trust, I have decided to take the matter of my inheritance into my own hands. \n\nThus, I have invited all of you: people of import in my life, to my home at Chesterfield. \nFrom there, the determining factor of who gets my money is simple:\n\nYou must survive one night. \n\nSimple, is it not? Whomever survives one night at my manner will split the entirely of my estate among themselves.\n And of course, if there is only ONE person left, they will be entitled to ALL of it...\nI myself can assure that is is enough money to be spent several lifetimes over. Far more than I could handle in all my years. \n\nI assure you my servants will supply you with all manner of resources to make your stay as comfortable as possible. I invite you to explore my library, conservatory, spacious parlors and billiards hall. \nShould you ever wish to leave the manor, all you need to do is walk out the front door. But once that is done, you will be disqualified, and not allowed in again. \n\nI would be so pleased for you to join us. \n\nThe date shall be the 13th of October, and we shall expect you all at the stroke of 6 o'clock sharp. \n\nKnowing you, I trust you will be there for your chance at my wealth.\n I offer only this last warning: \n\n~When gold is held in one hand, \nThe other may be bloodied~\n\nBest Regards, \nAgatha W. E. Chesterfield\"\n\nTonight is the eve. May the winner take all. \n\n", "name": "Tea & Treachery: The Mystery At Chesterfield Manor"}

If you like the universe, check out the manga or the anime - all credit goes to him.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the series, superhuman creatures known as \"ghouls\" blend in with human society. These creatures, however, can only derive nutrition from human meat. How they go about doing this can vary, along with their intentions, but they must always feed. The prominent Washu family founded the Commission of Counter Ghoul in Japan. They have since made technological breakthroughs in anti-ghoul weapons, giving humans a solid chance to stay on top of the food chain.\n\nThis game takes place in America, specifically New York City. While Japan is suffering the brunt of this surge of ghoul activity, other cities around the world are reporting a recent spike in ghoul-related murders as well. What was once an urban legend has become a grave reality to the rest of the world.\n\nThe American government has established their own CCG agency in response to the rapidly growing population across the country. The US-CCG works closely with their foreign sister agencies as a part of the International CCG Treaty, an initiative to cull the global ghoul population.\n\nAt the beginning of our story, New York City is highly divided. Citizens debate over how this situation should be handled, while the highly militarized CCG units show little restraint in both their investigations and raids on suspected ghoul hideouts. A small minority of humans cry out for ghoul rights, but this has fallen on deaf ears for the most part. Many others feel that the CCG is justified in their actions, fearful of the growing ghoul activity up north, some of which have become organized. Like Japan, the U.S. Government has recently declared harboring a ghoul to be a felony. While ghouls themselves are ordered to be killed on sight.\n\nNew York City is already divided into five districts, and the CCG monitors the estimated ghoul activity in each one. The Bronx has become almost uncontrollable - the CCG has effectively locked down the area as unrest spreads into Manhattan. Meanwhile, Staten Island and Brooklyn remain mostly peaceful. Any ghouls living there have kept a low profile and the CCG mostly leaves them alone, having bigger fish to fry. The Queens, however, is more complicated. Humans openly protest a variety of things, often clashing with one another. Some are fearful of ghouls, and others fearful of each other. Ghoul and CCG activity are about equal here, where our story first begins.\n", "name": "American Ghoul"}

Luckily for them, the crew of a ship always have a choice. They can bend their backs to the lash and take it, or they can fight back.\n\nTaking over the ship and renaming it to the *Scurvy Dog*, there is only one option left for the crew. They are already marked for death by the Crown, so why not take the final step ? A life of piracy is all that remains.\n\nWhat's more, the crew finds an old parchment in the possession of the poor, dead Captain. It tells of a mystical artifact, the Weatherstone. This magical rock is said to control the skies themselves. With control of the winds, who could ever stop the crew of the *Scurvy Dog* ?\n\nAll they have to do is track down the legend and survive the pursuing English fleet, mercenary pirate hunters, rival pirates, hostile natives, sea monsters, angry gods and worst of all, each other !\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nScurvy Dogs is a pirate adventure with a not-too-serious style. Think \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" rather than \"Master and Commander\". You don't need to know anything about ships, sailing or historical accuracy. This is just a fun adventure story.\n\nThere will be some elements of magic, myths and legends mixed in with more standard fare. The characters will start off as crew members, passengers or prisoners on an English navy vessel, and will then play through the mutiny and on to the adventure beyond. As such you should not write up a 'pirate' character initially, but rather a normal Navy crew member who will then become a pirate after the first couple of scenes. Female characters are welcome, although will have to start as passengers or prisoners until the mutiny at which point they will become pirate characters of equal standing to the male characters.\n\nThis is a pirate adventure, so cheating, back-stabbing, stealing, lying, betrayal and treason are all encouraged and will be rewarded !\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nI've narrated a few games here on Storium. I tend to play strongly to the cards. In other words, I rely heavily on challenges and on characters playing cards. I also expect players to write their posts to match the cards they play. It defeats the purpose if players just dump cards - each card needs to be explained and justified as to how it fits the challenge. This keeps the game more fair, even handed, and also more challenging for you as a player. If I can't see a reference to the card / challenge interaction in your post I will most likely ask you for revisions.\n\nEveryone is welcome, whether this is your first game or your fiftieth. But PLEASE only apply if you intend to play. If you're just going to check out the first couple of scenes and then disappear then please save us all some time. I expect players to post at least a couple of times a week. Again, if this sounds like too much then please don't apply. Apart from that, everyone is welcome !", "name": "Scurvy Dogs"}
{"id": "93dbb112-d630-42f0-8057-42051bf97362", "premise": "I do not know if anyone else on Storium has attempted this, but I am opening up a way for creative people to come together to make a new, DETAILED and SELF-CONSISTENT world that can be used for Storium games, long before the actual playing of the game, as well make a world that can used for any other creative endeavor. This has been done previously in the world of fiction book writers with the shared universe concept, leading to long series of novels and story collections, such as Thieves\u2019 World and 1632. Many of the great IPs have used multiple writers to expand their universe, such as Star Wars, Babylon 5, Forgotten Realms, and the Cthulhu Mythos. This project is different in that those who want to use it will not have to pay the traditional license fees. If this goes very well, this co-created world will lead to fan-fiction on individual websites, published stories and novels, and perhaps greater projects. \n\nOne major drawback to having multiple writers is that the canon can be decimated by conflicting versions of the setting and elements, which is frustrating to all. Just look at all of the reboots of the DC comic universe, or even the recent multiple reboots just in the Spider-Man movie franchise. That is why an overall editor is needed. I humbly nominate myself\u2014my project, my sensibilities will the final arbiter, though I hope that it will be considered a light touch, and I will make every attempt to be fair and gentle. I also submit for free the PROCESS to anyone else who wants to create their own world\u2014take a look at the following, and see if you would like to join in this experiment and/or create your own for other genres. \n\nWe will create a world with detail, which means there will be some give and take on ideas, as we mash various ideas over and over, in order to fit all concepts together logically. A team player mentality is necessary. We also need originality, so, though this may be inspired by many previous IPs (intellectual properties) such as Deadlands, the driving elements must be new. For example, magic is part of this world, but we will not be taking the fear mechanic from Deadlands that morphs the environment when the Reckoners have put enough fright into the local populace. That story element belongs to Pinnacle Entertainment, originated by their writers, and bless them for creating it for their universe. This will be an original world, created with original ideas, and must be different from what has been done before. \n\nBefore going further, I will give the legal foundation, which explains the way in which this is different than most other collaborative creative activities, then delve into the beginning of the story elements. \n\n\nMETA-STORY PARTICIPATION\n\nContributors, and creators of derivative works, by the act of participation, are agreeing to the following terms.\n\nContributors release the intellectual property claims to anyone who uses their contributions regarding invented technology, gadgets, timeline, history, events, and organizations. There will be a list of specifically released world important characters, otherwise, characters remain the property of their creator, except in a use of mere reference. No one may use someone else\u2019s created characters unless it has been specified as a released character, except as in a minor reference. No one may recreate someone else\u2019s stories, nor use their created dialogue.\n\nAnyone may propose to create their own stories from this setting, using the above released elements for their own use, and release for free or profit from their own story creations in any medium, including, but not restricted to: posting on the internet; Storium games; printed and electronic role playing games; providing a story to a print or electronic magazine; publishing an electronic or printed book of a story of any length; contributing a story or stories to an anthology of fiction; create a collection of stories; radio shows; podcasts; television series or movies; a script for a motion picture. \n\nSome of the conditions to creating works in this universe are those found on the website run by John M. Portley, the instigator of this project, who holds the copyrights to this universe. At this moment, his website regarding this project is:\n\nhttp://www.john-m-portley.com\n\nPermission to participate in creating works in this universe begins by communicating with John M. Portley regarding the medium to be used, the title and branding to be used, and whether payment will be made or value exchanged in the publishing and/or performance of the work. Notification of any payment is to communicated to John M. Portley within one month of payment. If compensation continues to be given to the author for the creative work, then updates of the on-going compensation must occur every three months.  \n\nSwearing is not to be present within any works of this universe, nor acts of a sexual nature. Titles and branding must be changed if the copyright holder deems it an infringement of another\u2019s on-going or proposed title or branding, or if it considered in bad taste by the copyright holder, John M. Portley, or his legal representatives. \n\nIf an individual or collective profits from a creation that is set in this collaborative world, then ten percent of the revenue of that creation will be given to a legal charity, of the author\u2019s choice, and proof of the income and gift to charity must be provided to John M. Portley, or his legal representatives within one month of that charity payment. \n\nThe charity payment must be made once annually, at the least.\n\nFailure to the stated conditions is surrendering the right to publish anything within this created world, any and all profits from using this setting are to be forfeited to John M. Portley, and will subject transgressors to legal prosecution for infringement, defamation, and court fees.\n\nMETA-STORY\u2014STEAMPUNK WEIRD WEST\n\nThough I want to keep this open to most ideas, and encourage all to think outside of the box, I do have a couple of caveats upfront. I do not enjoy stories that take away a character's free will. I really do not see the point. So, in the desire to have consistency, the first guideline of this world is that mind control is something that will not be possible more than it is in our present world, and, by association, reading of minds. Time travel is not possible by any method in this universe. Aside from that, please generate ideas, even the crazy ones, and let's see what will work well together. \n\nWhat marvels of transportation and manufacturing occurred? What technology or alternative science developed? \n\nWhat mythological elements or elements of magic are true in this setting?  \n\nBecause of the above alternative history, what organizations and conflicts have developed?\n\nBecause of the above, what set of events occurred, and what were the repercussions?  \n\nWho are the important individuals in this world\u2014the movers and shakers?  Let's create a list of people important on this world stage that others can use. \n\nWith each suggestion, let's work together to flesh out the idea, and see what works well together. \n\nIf this world is built up by numerous contributors, then I will create a wiki website at a timely junction to collect the elements into an encyclopedia of this world. \n\nPlease put questions to the Narrator in the Commentary section. Please suggest new ideas or tweaks to previous ideas in the Scene area. Just start a character with some references for yourself, such as country and a brief background of time wasters such as your various jobs in your life and what particular entertainments that you enjoy (yes, I will require to know something about the individuals with which I will be sharing a world).

If you see that there are already **5** players in the application pool but would like to join the game, please message me to let me know of your interest. I will do my best to periodically start up additional versions of this game and get new players in, or to invite new players if players drop from this.*", "name": "Defenders of Akakios (Game E)"}

The rest of the students, devastated by the unexpected loss, decided to carry on as if their classmate were still alive, going so far as to keep the desk in place and bringing it to the graduation ceremony. Yet no one could explain why their classmate, already dead and buried, was present on the graduation photo.\n\nThen, in the spring of 1998, the new class of room 3-3 had started to die off one by one in what appeared to be strange and unfortunate accidents. Many students blamed this on the past, about how a student seemingly appeared in a class, which caused the students to be picked off one by one. It appeared to be just local legend, but the students, and some of the staff, earnestly believed in what was happening to them.\n\nNow, in 2013, Yomiyama North Middle School class 3-3 is starting up again despite the rumors of what was happening to the previous classes. Officials play it off as superstitious nonsense, but allowed the student group Countermeasures to still be in place. The going on's were to be blamed on something the student's referred to as the 'extra', someone in the class who wasn't supposed to be there. The extra seat. The extra student. The one to blame for the curse that came on the class of 1998 in room 3-3.\n\nAs a student at North Yomiyama High, you have been placed into room 3-3 and may be aware of the curse. But nothing has happened in fifteen years, how could something happen now?\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nHey guys! This is a game based on a popular anime series called Another, where the class is picked off one by one from a curse. In this game, you will be part of the new class that is being cursed by this 'extra' student. No one knows who the extra is, and the extra student usually doesn't know that they're the extra either. But the curse isn't something that you can avoid easily.\n\nPeople will die.\n\nThat is the warning there, and I will reiterate it here real quick.\n\nPeople will die.\n\nThere will be plenty of deaths, I expect quite a bit of the cast to be killed before the end of the story. If you message me on Skype or Google, we can talk about you posting your own death scenes, but for those who do not, I will be controlling the instances. There can be survivors, and people can live out of this situation, but expect there to be multiple deaths before there is a true conclusion to the story.\n\nBut in the long run, I am looking for loads of character development with this sudden issue coming their way. You can play as the class teacher or a student in the class. I will only allow one teacher slot.\n\nSide note: The extra will be picked randomly, and will most likely not be informed that they are the extra. If you would like to know if you were selected as the extra, please let me know through my Skype on my profile or send me a message on google at sininchaos@gmail.com . If you would like to definitely not be the extra, please list that in the comments with your character profile so I can know before selecting the extra.\n\nOtherwise, you may direct any questions toward me through e-mail and Skype, and I look forward to playing with you all.", "name": "Another"}

There are millions of places on hundreds of worlds for criminals and outlaws to hide from the grasp of authorities on the more established worlds. When particularly infamous criminals go on the run, the standard practice is for agencies to put out bounties for their capture and leave the matter up to freelancers.\n\nBounty hunting can now be a very lucrative career for those with the skills and bravery to pursue it. Most bounty hunters operate in small groups, usually a single spaceship or a few traveling together. Some have grown very wealthy by capturing high profile criminals, now hunting their quarries with the latest in military equipment and the most advanced models of starships.\n\nThe crew of the *Albatross* are not one of those wealthy, sophisticated crews. The *Albatross* itself is a thoroughly outdated model, originally built as a cargo hauler rather than any kind of fighter craft. The crew have thus far barely managed to eke out a living by picking up petty criminals with minor bounties. Food, fuel, and maintenance have eaten up pretty much all their funds.\n\nStill, things could always change. It only takes one big capture to make the big time.

They had no fear of experimenting with the new discoveries, had no hesitation with altering themselves and had no shame in proving that they had learned how to become more than human. Most of all no one thought these amateurs would share what they had learned but they did.

I\u2019ve been on calls with Captain Abelson and the other captains all day, and the best we can come up with is some kind of hyperspace anomaly. But really, all that means is that we still don\u2019t know.

With pirates and anti-Alliance factions an ever-present danger, there are also mysterious, seemingly random problems plaguing the rest of the convoy. Time is not an ally, and even allies may not be trustworthy.\n\nYour captain, Eric Stark, is doing what he can to help find the way back into friendly space. Your task is to keep safe your mysterious cargo while trying to survive the constant threats of hostile space. There are many questions and too few answers here: Why did the Earth-based Alliance Navy hire civilian shipping contractors for such a secretive cargo? How did the entire convoy end up going adrift in hyperspace, sending you god-knows how far off your intended course? What is the cause of the strange maladies affecting both the ships of the convoy and their crews? Can you survive long enough to get any answers?\n\n***\n\n** *Vast Beyond* ** is intended to be a sci-fi drama along the lines of *Firefly*-meets-*Battlestar Galactica*. I'm looking for 4-5 players to take on the role of the crew of the *Vast Beyond*. Players will deal with the threat of attacks on their convoy, the mystery of an unknown cargo and an accident which has left their convoy lost in unfamiliar space. The primary goal will be to return to Alliance space.\n\nCharacters will be pushed to their limits (and possibly beyond) as they scramble to survive and find a way home. It's possible that not all of them will make it out alive.

Ruled by the benevolent, wise, and powerful Emperor Goltannus, this land of goodness and righteousness has brought civilization to the uncivilized and has protected those who have no other protection. There is truly no greater realm in which to live.\n\nThat is what the official imperial propaganda says. The more cautious citizens of Goltannia would never dare to disagree. After all, those who would dare to suggest that the Emperor or his loyal servants are anything less than correct in all things tend to disappear into the realm's many, many imperial prisons. There is no tolerance for sedition in Goltannia.\n\nNor is there tolerance for witchcraft, thievery, worshiping the \"wrong\" god, evading the imperial draft currently in effect, or any number of other entries on the long, long list of offenses against the empire. Those who disobey soon find themselves in chains, forced to toil in endless labor to help keep the massive imperial army properly supplied.\n\nAs many suffered under the emperor's brutal reign, whispers of rebellion began to spread. Could those who had been oppressed for so long finally seize the opportunity to rise up and seize the freedoms they had been so long denied? Only time would tell.\n\n** OOC Information **\n\nThis is a somewhat dark fantasy story about a small group struggling against a massive evil empire. However, the characters are not necessarily idealistic and righteous. They may be working against the empire for purely selfish reasons, to gain power for themselves, or just acting out of good old fashioned revenge.\n\nAt the start of the story, all characters are incarcerated in one of the empire's many prisons/dungeons/labor camps. Please provide an explanation for how and why they were taken prisoner along with your character description. If you'd like it to be a secret, feel free to let me know in private messages or comments on the character page.\n\nI'm looking for a group of between three and five players. As with all my games, this one is LGBT friendly. No word limits, past tense preferred. Pre-made cards have been provided to offer some suggestions, but please feel free to write your own custom nature, strength, weakness, and subplot cards.\n\nHere are some notes on the setting to provide background and character ideas:\n\n** Races **\n\nThe Emperor and all nobility in Goltannia are human. Elves, dwarves, and other nonhuman races are found throughout the empire, but they are very much second class citizens. Owning land is prohibited for most nonhumans and they face systemic discrimination.\n\nThe Empire has just completed a years-long conquest of dwarven territory and is currently at war with a large elven kingdom. Consequently, elves and dwarves are regarded with particular distrust. Just being suspected of sympathizing with the Emperor's enemies can be enough to get someone imprisoned.\n\n** Religion **\n\nThe Emperor claims to be a direct descendant of Goltan the Just, a powerful god of civilization and order. As such, while the existence of other gods is acknowledged, worship of Goltan is the only approved religion within the empire.\n\nSometimes authorities turn a blind eye to rites associated with certain gods and goddesses who are regarded as part of Goltan's pantheon, but other faiths are strictly forbidden. Practicing the wrong religion can result in imprisonment, particularly if someone is suspected of actually spreading illegal teachings.\n\n** Magic **\n\nMagic exists throughout the world and can be mastered through diligent study, though some are born with greater innate talents for it than others. According to his propaganda, the Emperor himself is among the world's most powerful wielders of the arcane.\n\nThere are several varieties of magic. Some use it to bend the elements to their will. Others employ it to heal wounds and illnesses. Others can use it to see glimpses of the future or faraway places. Some say magic can even raise the dead. Most who practice magic tend to focus on a particular aspect, as it is nearly impossible to master a wide variety of spells.\n\nOnly the nobility and officially sanctioned imperial magi in service to the army are permitted to practice magic. For all others, the practice of magic is considered witchcraft, a very serious crime.\n\n** Crime **\n\nThe Goltannian justice system can be incredibly harsh. Long prison sentences are common even for minor offenses like petty theft. The system is also corrupt, allowing the wealthy and those who have the Emperor's favor to escape punishment for much more serious offenses.\n\nPart of the reason for these harsh laws is that prisoners are employed to keep the economy of the empire functioning. With a large portion of the empire's able bodied youth drafted into mandatory military service, prisoners are used as labor in the mines and fields, keeping the military supplied.\n\nOne small merciful side effect of this policy is that the death penalty is rarely used. After all, a dead man cannot provide valuable labor. Execution is generally limited to those deemed too dangerous to keep alive, such as powerful magic users or leaders of treasonous plots.\n\n** The Military **\n\nA military draft has been in effect across the Empire for the past five years. All able bodied individuals between the ages of sixteen and thirty are required to serve in the military. Nobles are exempt from this service, as are those wealthy enough to afford a rather substantial payment.\n\nAttempting to evade the draft or desertion from military service typically results in a lengthy imprisonment.\n\n** Last Comments **\n\nFeel free to message me with any questions.

Year 2057 has arrived with the development of supernatural beings mingling in the human realm. Their presence is noted by their offhand appearances, strange behaviors, or terrifying actions.\n\n*Background: In year 2045, after remaining hidden from humans for the majority of the centuries gone, various supernatural beings are exposed. Due to an explosion of new technology and higher levels of evidence, the inevitable wake of supernatural creatures occurred. It began with the uncovering of ghosts through factual-based video recordings, then the containment of a specimen. Afterwards, the exploration of other possible beings such as vampires, werewolves, demons, and angels became aware to the human eye through avid hunting and fanatic searching. Once thoroughly exposed to the public, different species were labeled and identified by various markers, which they were forced to wear as of 2050. These markers were felt teardrops: red (vampires), grey (werewolves), iridescent (ghosts), black (demons), and silver (angels). This was the first obvious division between the humans and supernatural beings. In 1953, war broke out amongst the divided sides, but the supernatural side quickly fell apart since there were tensions between certain subgroups (such as demons and angels, etc). As consequence, human leaders designated supernatural creatures to various sects across the country, mainly in the Western Hemisphere. This divided much of America between humans in the East and supernatural beings in the West. As typical, supernatural beings are prejudiced regardless of where they live or what they are. They have limited access to career choices, citizenship rights, natural/Constitutional rights, and a slew of other factors.*\n\nThis is a time of segregation between the supernatural and the human species---with humans being the forerunners of inspiring this fear against the unknown.\n\n*Who will you be or become?

Both Mazant and Vul Gar slowly fell for Ent.\n\n\nVul Gar because she could see the beauty in his ugliness.\n\nMazant because she was as beautiful and inelegant as himself.\n\nEnt attempted to settle the argument by Marring the cold and distance 2nd child Grim. Grim however refused and vanished from the High lands to be one with the universe itself. Grim wanted nothing to do with the lower aspirations of his brothers or humanity.\n\nMazant and Vul Gar rallied their most loyal and went to war, a war which would last nearly a hundred years and turned the beautiful and magical High lands into a hell.\n\nThis would be known as the War of the Children.\n\nUnable to deal with the death and destruction caused by the war over her, Ent tricked both the Brothers into a meeting with her promising to close one. instead of choosing she struck deathblows to both of them. Ending the war.\n\nVul Gar's people took their fallen into the mountains of the northland, burying him in stone and snow. Then breaking into tribes to live in a place that required strength, and to worship their fallen master.\n\nMazant's people took him to the West coats, to bury him by Ocean, burning him at sunset on the ocean, They then founded the Holy Empire of Mazant to follow his teachings.\n\nEnt's followers accompanied her to the green lands of the south, unable to live with the horror her existence had cause she took root and became a great and powerful tree, her roots stretching out for miles and insuring the prosperity of the Forest. Her followers stayed and promised to follower her teachings forming the Affiliation of Ent.\n\nThis ended the Era of The Children and Began the Era of Humanity.\n\nAfter the children had left the Highlands the Humans began to rebuild. The war had more then halved the population, so a long period of peace began out of need.\n\nThe Children had been extremely powerful beings, forged from The one, creator of the universe. Their deaths were not as absolute as thought. Upon death their power, magic, or essence was released like the fallout of a nuclear bomb over the country sides of their burial.\n\nThe essence began to have strange effects, leaving some humans untouched, and others were changed almost fully into other races, of beings giving birth to the Children of magic.\n\nMazant's essence created first the Angels. Gaunt and extremely pale fair harried humans with pupiless eyes. There inherent intelligence made them almost worshipped among the people of the Empire. They are believed to be the Face of their fallen lord. Mazant's essence also created the Vermin. Rat people who evolved from the sewers under Mazant's huge civilizations, the race is looked down on and often referred to as 'Mazant's Mistake' nevertheless they are resourceful and full of surprises. Sea Kings are huge Man Sharks born of the ocean and the seas. They would be useful in battle if they could be removed from the sea for any length of time. instead they prefer the coast and the hundreds of islands dotting the ocean.\n\nVul Gar's Essence imbedded in the rock and stone of the great mountain range, Creating the image of Vul Gar The Orks. Tall and muscle bound creatures armed with strength and brutality are a force to be dealt with in a fight, as an opposite the Goblins showed up. Goblins were short and weaker, but somehow wiser and more intelligent then the Orks. Then the Stouts appeared, short stocky Humans who seemed nearly unkillable.\n\n\nEnt's First children where the Elves. Humans with a better agility and ability to here in the forest they habited, Then came the Ellets, tall and covered in fur they looked like Weasels that had bred with humans, there speed and precision unmatched. Finally the trolls migrated to the Swamps and Marshes of the South, becoming war like and solitary.\n\nEach place still had Human's to populate it but now they shared the planet with these new races, each falling into balance with the others.\n\nThe Children of Magic were not the only effect the Essence had on the word.\n\nslowly, very intuitive Humans and creatures began to become aware of the essence blowing throughout the land. After a small time some would come forward with the ability to absorb the Essence and then you the essence to bend reality around them as if they were a god.\n\nThey were called Adepts.\n\nWith the rise of the Adepts many soothesayer's would travel the lands in order to find potential Adepts and take them away to become Adepts.\n\nOne such was Mas Tafo.\n\nHe came from a city on the border between the north and south lands at their eastern most part, in what is now referred to as the valley of sorrow.\n\nBefore it was know as the Farm town of Nex.\n\nMas Tafo was a normal Farm child but when a pack of traveling Soothsayers came to Town they determined Mas Tafo to have the greatest potential.\n\nIn order to make a better life for his family, Mas Tafo left home in order to learn the ways of the Adept and return prosperous.\n\nMany years past and Mas Tafo learned fast, picking up the teachings and abilities with breathtaking precision. He became enamored with the Child of Death, Grim. The last remaining Child of The One. He turned his skills to the foundation of a new type of Adept... The Necromancer.\n\nNever getting his restoration to work perfectly, Mas Tafo skill became a great Adept, and once he felt he had acquired all the riches needed he returned home to share it with his family and kinsman.\n\nThis was not to be.\n\na northern Tribe of Barbarians known as the Thrul, had entered into a war with a Race of Creatures the Affiliation recognized as Trolls. The Battle raged on for years and sadly Nex was on the front line.\n\nMas Tafo returned to his home to find two blood thirsty armies doing battle in the ruined shadow of his former home town of Nex. His family and friends long since caught in the storm of fire and war.\n\nMas Tafo strode across the battlefield without fear till he arrived at the center. it is said he used all of his anger and will power to absorb all of the Essence in the distant area, summoning all his strength he punched a hole in the fabric of Space and time and plunged his hand into the universe. His fingers found the last Child of the One The Child of Death Grim himself.\n\nMas tafo dragged him from the neither reaches of the universe To The Highlands once again.\n\nIn that instant Grim's power exploded through the whole uncontained wiping out the Northern Tribe and The trolls in on second reducing them to nothing but bones.\n\nNo Trolls have been seen to this day.\n\nMas Tafo demanded Grim use his power and knowledge to return his family and land to its one time glory. Grim refused, unable to make such things happen, but instead he made a promise...\n\nAny one raised through use of Essence on the lands of the dead would return permanently.Then vanished leaving of Mas Tafo and the essence of Death himself.\n\nMas Tafo decided to rebuild. claiming the eastern lands he had corrupted as the dead lands, any necromancer who brought back the dead on the ground of those lands would return permanently.\n\nSo the Forth kingdom, and possibly the most feared, was created. The Deadlands.\n\nThe Holy Empire's technological advancement and population growth is staggering, and the High priest Zealous considers expanding it's bounders at the expense of the north and the Affiliation.

That was all remedied a few centuries later by the Emperor Hadrian IV.  By AD 1900, the Known World was all under Roman control.  It was then that the Empire began turning their vision skyward...\n\nIt is now AD 2129, and Roman scientists have unlocked the secrets of interstellar travel.  With the invention of  Quam Celerius Lucem (QCL) Drives, Roman vessels have established Colonia Proxima Centauri, a habitable world populated by primitive barbarians who were easily overcome.\n\nFirst contact has been made with a tribe of space-faring extraterrestrial barbarians known as the Pomeranii.

Her mission is straight forward:  Defend Colonia Proxima Centuri, and carry the Eagles forward for the Glory of Rome!\n               ------------------\n**RULES AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**\nSetting:  The story is an alternate history/science fiction drama which takes place in the 22nd Century AD. \n\n**Premise:**  Imperial Rome never fell, and now it is reaching for the stars. By the end of the 20th Century AD, Rome was master of the entire world. Although each and every region of Earth was not under the Empire\u2019s direct control (some regions being autonomous \u201cclient states\u201d), Roman hegemony over the planet was unquestioned. Roman exploration of the solar system proceeded briskly, and with the discovery of Quam Celerius Lucem (\u201cFaster Than Light\u201d) technology, the exploration of nearby stars has just begun. Rome has one colony on an Earth-like world discovered at Proxima Centauri. The \u201cbarbarians\u201d (native sentient species) living there were quickly subjugated, and Roman control of the planet has recently been consolidated. That\u2019s when they discovered, in a rather unpleasant encounter, a new race of space-faring barbarians who appear bent on violently opposing any further human expansion.\n\n**Tone:**  Think \u201cI, Claudius\u201d meets \u201cStarship Troopers.\u201d The style is that of a historical novel, with the caveat that it\u2019s a future history. The tone is serious, for the most part, though there will certainly be room for humor. Heck, trying to come up with Latin phrases for high-tech gadgetry induces a comedy style all its own...!\n\n**Game Pace:**  1 scene every 10 days or so. \n\n**Writing Style:**  Third Person, Past Tense. (\u201cMarcus opened the hatch cautiously.\u201d NOT: \u201cMarcus opens the hatch cautiously\u201d or \u201cI open the hatch cautiously.\u201d) Length of posts may vary for each player, but so far the game posts have averaged 2-3 substantial paragraphs.\n\nYou can see the type of writing style we\u2019re hoping to see by reading some of the posts already made. Well-constructed sentences using decent punctuation, spelling and capitalization should be the norm (rather than, Marcus looked at His fello romans than Opened the Door. come Quickly he yelled to The Others behind Him)\n\n**Number of players:**  We are looking for a total of 4 to 6 players, though that number is flexible. \n\n**Player characteristics:**  Our players will be humans with normal strengths and weaknesses. They will be either Roman citizens (with Romanized names) or humans from one of Rome\u2019s semi-autonomous client states on Earth. They have the option of having been born in Roman colonies on the Moon, Mars, or one of the industrial/mining outposts on Europa, Io, Titan, or the asteroid belt. If a participant would like help in coming up with a suitably Roman-sounding name, we can assist there!\n\n**Player roles**:  There are several crew positions available: Operations Tribune (Officer), Communications Tribune, Engineering Tribune, Natural Philosopher (Science Officer), Contubernalis (Ensign), Veteran Legionary \n\n**Power scale:**  The characters in this story are talented and capable humans, with all the strengths and weaknesses one might expect. None of our players will be aliens or beings gifted with extraordinary powers. The normal human abilities of ambition, greed, malice, pride, martial or technical prowess, idealism, honor, and scientific curiosity should be sufficient to drive our characters (and the story) forward.\n\n**Leaving the Game**: Players who are unable to participate for an extended period of time (vacation, RW work commitments) must notify the Narrator, who will work out a plausible storyline for the character\u2019s absence. If a Player is no longer able to participate, that Player must contact the Narrator, and they will work out a good \u201cexit strategy\u201d to write their character out of the story. Players who fail to participate or check in for an extended period of time will be retired from the game; the Narrator will write the character out of the story in whichever way the Narrator determines is the best fit for the current storyline.\n\n**KEEP IN TOUCH!**  Players are requested to keep in touch with the Narrator.  If you are going to be away for a couple of week, just let me know...*please!*  If  you decide you need to leave the game at some point, please let me know that as well...don't keep me guessing. \n\n**Any Questions?*  email me at tacronicus.cornelius@gmail.com", "name": "ROMANS IN SPACE!"}

No; like most forms of vermin, they found a way to survive, even thrive, despite the destruction.\n\nExactly how it came about is lost to history, but what *is* known is that somehow, in the desperation of those final days, the fractured nations of Earth managed to work together.

This is a chance to send out the brightest and best of a ship's youth as ambassadors, to bring honour to both their old and new homes.  Or, at least, that's what it's *supposed* to be.\n\nIn practice, it's usually more a matter of getting rid of troublemakers: those who shirk their own duties, disrupt those of others, or who are simply in some way inconvenient.  The thinking seems to be that if the flight doesn't frighten them into compliance, well, once they get there, they're someone else's problem anyway.\n\nIt was supposed to be just another routine exchange.  But this time, when the Armada ship *Manifest Destiny* sent out their latest batch of young ne'er-do-wells, it didn't make it to the planned destination.

No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford.*\"\n\n**Samuel Johnson, in The Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.D. (1791) by James Boswell**\n\nThis is the tale of two cities, both are called London. \n\nOne city is the city seen on picture postcards and described in guide books. The city tourists come to see and commuters see in passing. The city eight million people work in by day and sleep in at night. The city which is guarded by Bobbies and is ruled by an elected mayor. The city where money is earned in the towers of the City and spent in the shopping streets of Westminster. The city that has been rebuilt after each disaster that struck it. That city is known as London.\n\nThen there is the other city. The city rarely seen on photographs and only described in fairy tales. The city tourists and commuters rarely get glimpses of. The city inhabited by a community of thousands and ignored by millions. The city guarded by Aldermen and ruled by the Midnight Mayor. The city where money is worthless and power and status are currency. The city that wasn\u2019t affected much by the Great Fire of 1666 or the Blitz. That city is known by many names. London Below, London\u2019s Shade, The Soul of the City, Londinium.\n\nThis is the tale of those two cities and those who live in both. \n\n\u201c*It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way - in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.*\u201d\n\n**A Tale of Two Cities - Charles Dickens**\n\n\nOur tale of two cities starts on 5 February 1952. Where in one city it is the end of an era because of the death of beloved king George VI and the beginning with a new era with the accession of young Queen Elizabeth II. In this city, the aftermath of the war is still felt and the end of the British Empire is an unwelcome reality. \n\nIn the other London a power struggle looms on the horizon. A new monarch in the upper world always is reflected as a struggle of dominance and control of the seats of power in London Below.\n\nThis is the story of those caught up in that struggle.\n\n<><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>\n\nThis story will start with six or seven characters. I have sent invites to those who expressed interest in the forum post: Magical London as a living city (https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfg/thread/kaswza)\n\nA lot more background information about this story and the background, plus some of the rules can be found there. \n\n***This story is inspired by many sources. The main inspiration is the Matthew Swift series by Kate Griffin. The Midnight Mayor, the Aldermen, the city sorcerers, the basic setup all come from this series. But it is only inspired by this series, it is not the law writ large. We\u2019ll be deviating from the basic premise in many ways. Sorcerers will still be the most powerful of mortal magic users, but I\u2019ve added a few other classes of mages not featured in the series. We\u2019ll start in in the fifties and in that I\u2019ve let myself be inspired by Grant Morrison\u2019s The Invisibles and the Doctor Who episode The Idiot's Lantern. Kate Griffin\u2019s series is quite bleak and I hope to have some of the whimsy of Gaiman\u2019s Neverwhere in this story. Other influences are the Rivers of London series by Ben Aaronovitch, Felix Castor series by Mike Carey, Alex Verus series by Benedict Jacka,Jonathan Strange and Mr. Norrell by Susanna Clarke, The Night Circus l by Erin Morgenstern, and many others.***\n\n\nOn character creation: \n\n**All characters start out as human. They may have magical powers and abilities, but they are basically human. There will be many other supernatural beings in this setting, but I want the players' characters to be a human as possible, at least in the beginning.**\n\n**We start in 1952. This means that all characters should be part of that time. Research it if need be. So a young anti-establishment character can be a Teddy boy or a rocker, but not a mod, punk, or skin head. Older characters can be WWII veterans or if they're really old veterans from the Great War. (In creating the cards, I sometimes used art which isn't time appropriate, don't be led by that. So the martial artist may be able to navigate the city in a very athletic manner, it won't be called parkour for at least another fifty years.)**\n\n**We'll start in 1952, but the story will progress through the rest of the 20th century. Real history will be the background to this story. Characters will age, unless they have magic to keep them young. So starting out with a relatively young character is preferable.**\n\n**All characters are tied to London. They may have lived there all their lives, they may be recent immigrants, but the all have strong feelings for London, whether positive or negative.**\n\n**All characters have ties to both Londons. They once started out in London Above, but through happen stance they also became part of London Below, probably due to their innate magical abilities. It can also be the other way around; that the discovery of an aspect of London Below gave them their abilities. Whatever may be the case, they haven't yet cut of the ties with London above. They may still have family or other responsibilities there. They will also be relatively new to London below.**\n\n**London is an integral part of the setting. I want to keep it as real as possible. So the actual geography and features of the city will come into play. Familiarity with London will help, but you are encouraged to study up on London through Wikipedia, Google Maps, etc. Expect to be sent polite revision requests, if you make mistakes.**\n\n**We will write in a third-person past tense form. Your character's bio doesn't have to reflect that style. Be as creative as possible in describing your character. Journal entries, job interviews, stream-of-consciousness dreams, whatever you think is appropriate.**\n\n**We will need one of each Nature, so if you're late in creating a character, carefully look at what others have created. Some natures are optional, but I need at least one Alderman, one City Sorcerer, one Druidic Sorcerer, one Seer, and one Necromancer.**\n\n**I want to start this story on Saturday 10-1-2015. So take your time in creating your characters.**\n\n**6-1-2015 - NOTE: SO FAR A SEER, AN ALDERMAN, A DRUIDIC SORCERER, A CITY SORCERER, AND A NECROMANCER HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED. NEW CHARACTERS HAVE A GREATER CHANCE OF BEING ADMITTED IF THEY ARE OF ANOTHER NATURE, THOUGH I'LL ACCEPT MULTIPLE CITY SORCERERS.**", "name": "All That Life Can Afford"}

It is done only at a time pad set up in large, room size facilities with lots of technical gear.  Typically your team is dropped somewhere in the past and given some interval, usually 3 to 15 days to carry out the mission and ** THEN YOU AND YOUR TEAM ARE AUTOMATICALLY EXTRACTED AT A SPECIFIC TIME, WHICH WAS SET AT THE BEGINNING OF YOUR MISSION,  REGARDLESS WHERE YOU ARE OR WHAT YOU ARE DOING. YOU CAN ONLY RETURN TO THE TIME PAD YOU LAUNCHED FROM, ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER YOUR MISSION STARTED, LOCAL TIME.**\n\n-----\nTypes of Characters \n\n**In the Time Guard **-. This is recommended for new writers to storium.  It is the most structured environment with the most cannon already created. Your Boss is Agent Tango, and you can read about him in previous Pathfinder stories. The guard takes all types of personalities and backgrounds, but it helps if your character has at least one significant skill or specific knowledge. For example knowledge of history, art, theater...is as important as economics, science or technology, it is all useful. Characters inside of the Time Guard find a more structured world, clear cut tasks, and this is what makes it easier for new players.  \n\n **Time Guard Rogue agents** -Rogue agents are for characters returning from previous Time Guard Stories. They are already deeply embedded in the story and know many of the other story threads in play. \n\n\n**Characters not in the Time Guard** - These characters should be from our current time in history. They are harder to create but can be a lot of fun if your up to the challenge. You need to explain how they relate or will relate to other characters or the events that the guard is engaged. You should expect and be ready to interact with me, in detail, in creating this type of character, because it needs to fit well into the existing story world.\n\nHowever these characters, that are outside of the guard, can be anything, a mom, a waiter, a student, etc. that have been caught up in the events and relationships of people engaged in the story.  \n\nI like big canvas worlds, that permit all types of stories, romance, action, adventure, exploration...\nBut some writers find these big worlds, with no clear horizons, harder to write about.  So inside the big world, is the focus for each story, each game goal the stories should arc back toward, The  Principal Goal of  this chapter of the story is to bring down the time barrier that prevents the Time Guard from traveling to the future. \n\n=====", "name": "Time Guard - Rogue's War (Season Three)"}

Most voices only have 2, but you can start with 3 if you start with 7 willpower instead of 10.\n\nThis game uses a currency called *Willpower* to earn the spot to control John.\n\nYour obsessions are the things your personality really wants to achieve, it is essentially a life endeavour. They come in three different tiers: Level 1 (pretty easy), Level 2 (more difficult/risky) and Level 3 (nearly impossible). You need one of each. Please write your obsessions in your character discussion area (not description!) and I will grade them if they're not graded correctly already.\n\nScoring is simple: Add up all the (obsession level * number of times achieved) and that is your total score for the game. The highest score wins.\n\nBids, skills and your obsessions can be recorded in the character log between me and yourself. You should keep these private if you want to play competetively. I will give you your own private google spreadsheet keeping track of everything for you once you have given me all the required information.\n\nWhen in control of John, typically you would describe the action that John undertakes and roll a die to confirm whether it succeeds or not. For this you will post the action that you would like John to undertake along with an optional willpower bid and I will be calling out the roll on my end in the discussion on the right. (Storium, you should have text dice rolls already like Roll20!)\n\n---\n\nPersonalities can be named to your liking. A picture and description are encouraged, the description detailing how John received your personality.\n\nNone of Storium's obstacles, strengths, weaknesses or subplots will be used in this game, so you can just leave them blank.", "name": "Everyone is John"}

I am not opposed to NSFW or gore. I do prefer players 21 or older. This game will wade deep in philosophical and theological waters.\n\nx3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x\n\n**The Fall of the Pogrom** based on **Mage the Ascension** (*not awakening*)\n\nx3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x\n\nThe 1990s were some of the hardest times to be a mystic. The philosophical rise of modernism was at its crescendo and people were certain there was a right way and a wrong way to do all things. Even people of a progressive persuasion abandoned their \u201clive and let live\u201d viewpoints and adopted harsh views of political correctness. This rigid world view was all part of the Technocracy Pogrom to shut down and control the paradigm in every culture. Those who control the prevailing paradigm, control the power and can subject anyone else to their will. \n\nWith every crescendo there is eventually a denouement.\n\nThe internet was on the rise and there were a series of wars online between the technocrats who were trying to squash mysticism and the virtual adepts who used their computers as a focus for their magic. The dot.com crash in 2000 was in part due to the ensuing wars between those of a creative technical magical bent and those who wanted technical spirituality to die a quick and merciless death. While the technophiles locked horns in an epic battle for the internet, the rise of postmodernism as a philosophical view began to engulf colleges, universities, business views, and more. Multiculturalism, deconstruction of traditional views, and the slow erosion of propaganda became so common place normal folks who benefitted from power and bias started to realize that what they had been told might not be valid.  While that meant that people were questioning things like why their country was at war, it also meant some questioned routine health benefits like fluoride in water or vaccinations. Belief in conspiracy theories was an outgrowth of a post-modernism and are now currently threatening the pogrom\u2019s control of the mass of humanity. \n\nBy the 2008 crash and ensuing \u201cgreat recession\u201d movements like Occupy Wall Street openly talked about how broken and paid for that the US government officials were. Add that to the growing citizen concern about the controls and surveillance on the internet, and even normal humans were starting to wonder why such control was necessary. Who was the government, or rather those who shape the reach of the government, really looking for? It obviously wasn\u2019t serial rapists, pedophiles and murderers, because those were at an all-time high. The New World Order was gaining too much control, but also exposing itself in the meantime. \n\nThe technocracy\u2019s New World Order and the virtual adepts continue their war, but the other traditions have been struggling. Hermetic chantries in pocket dimensions have been disconnected from this world by the Void Engineers. The drug war sent many Ecstatics to safer countries as they were being targeted and arrested for 'drug trafficking'. Many Akashics have been recalled to protect Tibetan Chantry from the Chinese technocratic pogrom. Dreamspeakers have thrived and expanded due to newfound wealth from casinos. Their new power and influence extends to communities near their cities, and several of their chantries are thriving. The Sons of Ether have been but absorbed by the virtual adepts, but have been focusing their work on nanites, 3d printers and other sciences that change what we assume about creating matter out of thin air. Verbena have been growing at a steady but very slow rate and have made more inroads in Europe than in the United States except in cities like Salem Oregon and Massachusetts. The Celestial Chorus is likely the most fractured of all the traditions because of the lack of faith as an outgrowth the rise of atheism (thanks pogrom!) and political and social attacks on Islam, social justice oriented Christianity, etc. Other traditions have drawn those who awaken into their fold as paths less reviled than believing in a God.  Due to the rise in conflicts between magi and technocrats, the Euthanatos have managed to move out of their stereotypical death cult background and into a more ordered and systematic tradition open to explaining why it is that they give the good death to those who threaten others. This unveiling from secrecy has generally been accepted by other traditions, though they may be uneasy about the focus on death. The Euthanatos have learned to hybridize their viewpoint to work in conjunction with other magi. Even the magi who were once called Orphans are now choosing other traditions or at very least working with the Euthanatos on very rare occasion to protect themselves. \n\nYou are a new cabal of the best that the traditions have to offer. You were hand picked to represent your tradition, or were at very least expendable. Your goal is to shift the paradigm of Detroit, to weaken the pogrom, to undermine the Technocracy. You are all nearly adepts and can speak a sort of Esperanto to discuss the spheres of magic with your collegues. (Life, Matter, Entropy, etc.) You were chosen for your creativity and strength of paradigm (in whatever that may be). \n\nSetting: Detroit has been falling off the map of Technocratic influence for the last 25 years. It\u2019s nearly dystopian in terms of economy, infrastructure, etc. Syndicate headquarters here is failing miserably. Iteration X has few if any functioning robots. The New World Order can\u2019t seem to keep CCTV up and running properly. Progenetors act more like a medical corps for the few Technocratic agents left. \n\nx3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x\n\n**OOC**\n\nThis game is based on Mage the Ascension. You need to make a character from the nine traditions. Orphans would not be chosen for this assignment; however they could be a local mage and added later into the plot. \n\nEvery time you cast magic, you must say how and why your spell would work in conjunction with your belief system: the more exquisite the detail the better. All magi require a focus or several foci to work magic. The more overt the magic (ie: how obvious is it to \u201cmuggles/sleepers\u201d) the harder you will be smacked by paradox. You have some control as to how that will play out. \n\nx3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x3x\n\n**Your character should include the following:**\n \n1)\tYour tradition and view of your tradition?\n\n2)\tYour paradigm/philosophy/religion (should be more than just a tradition name but personal world view)?\n\n3)\tYour awakening story?\n\n4)\tYour foci?\n\n5)\tWhy you were chosen for this assignment? \n\n6)\tWhat are your spheres of understanding magical understanding?

The subjects grow more independent as the military and political control from Solara weakens. Dangers grow in the countryside. No one is certain what the future might bring.

They called themselves C.L.O.A.K. -Centralized Logistics Organized Against Ksarrus. They claimed that their primary purpose was to defend the Earth against invasion from alien lifeforms - The Ksarrus. Shortly after forming, it soon became clear that they considered themselves to be an agency for containing international affairs, as well as the only organization prepared to defend the planet against external invasion.\n\nAt first, it appeared as if they knew something that the rest of humanity didn't. They were not a part of any existing government, they did not seem prepared to follow any existing laws, and no one was quite sure where their funding came from. Worst of all, their equipment, public statements, and military movements all looked as if they were preparing for an imminent invasion - but they refused to provide proof of alien activity. They wouldn't even show evidence that the Ksarrus existed.\n\nThree years passed, and C.L.O.A.K. became a powerful military force with no government to answer to. They solved problems in their own way, dealing out justice of their own accord. From the  perspective of the United Nations, it looked as if C.L.O.A.K. was acting as judge, jury, and executioner. They were outside of anyone's control.\n\nBefore five years had passed, C.L.O.A.K. was labeled a terrorist organization. Countries from across the world drew together to eliminate C.L.O.A.K., and in the year 2020, World War 3 began. The war was small in comparison to its two predecessors. It was a war fought with elite strike teams, with bribes, and with blackmail over the darkest of secrets. It was a war out of sight, out of mind, behind the scenes; there was no open combat, no widespread destruction, and the public was hardly aware it even took place.\n\nBy the year 2023, C.L.O.A.K.'s advanced technology allowed their strike teams to become the dominating force. Another two longs years of skirmishes happened before, in 2025, World War 3 ended. C.L.O.A.K. had been victorious, and with their new-found status as a legitimate organization, they began to change the world.\n\nFor the first time in its history, the planet came together to declare a singular global currency - credits - and a global language - English. C.L.O.A.K. allowed many of the countries to retain their preexisting leadership and state of independence. Overtime, the organization guided the nations of the world into working together to create economic stability, under a unified Earth.\n\nIt is now the year 2030, five years after World War 3. Earth is in a global boom, but there are still those who fight for independence. There are those who do not want equality, who do not want unity, and who do not want to live under the rule of C.L.O.A.K.\n\nYou are a member of C.L.O.A.K.'s elite military strike teams. Your duty, as one of the most well trained humans on the planet, is to serve as an international police force; your mission, to eliminate those who would threaten unity - who would threaten peace.\n\nAnd, as you have so consistently heard from your superiors - to always be prepared for the impending Ksarrus invasion.\n\n--------------------------------\n**Out of Character Information**\n\nHello everyone! In this section I'll give you a brief overview of what to expect, and some ground rules going into our story.\n\nThe players of this story will consist of two strike teams, or squads, that have been paired together. Foxtrot is a primary squad filled with more experienced C.L.O.A.K. members, while Tango is a secondary, more support based squad with slightly newer members. I'm looking for six players - one of each of the nature cards I created. \n\nEach squad will have a leader that is an npc, controlled by me. While Storium is built around combined storytelling, I tend to be a control freak about plot and non-player characters that I introduce. I am open to discussion about ideas for introducing characters from your player character's past, but I'd prefer you to ask before just taking control.\n\nMy experiences with Storium over the past month, and roleplaying in general, suggest that many players are prone to dropping out after a week or two. If that happens, I understand. The characters will become npcs, or be dealt with in a way fitting to the story. Then, if a total of three players drop, I shall re-open for invites, to fill another squad. Hopefully, through this process, we will be able to keep going at a decent pace with a minimum of three players.\n\nAs I've said, I'm looking for six characters, one of each of the nature cards I have created. So, keep that in mind when making a character, . In order to accept the best characters, I may ask some of you to change your nature card, if, that is, people accidentally double up. I apologize in advance for making you do this.\n\nFor Strengths and weaknesses (as well as sub-plots), feel free to create your own. From the start, I will give you an item card that plays off of your natures strength, so you do not need to make your strength card based off of that. Example: If you choose the medic, your strength does not need to be medical knowledge - I will give you another card for that.

Some say it ended the day that the Gates appeared. Others say that it was a great awakening.\n\nThe Gates first appeared as huge dome structures that covered expanses of the world. They were solid and made of a new form of energy. Contact with anyone inside was impossible.\n\nAt the same time a quarter of the stars disappeared from the sky. All in a band leaving a dark line across the night sky.\n\nAfter a week the structures disappeared as suddenly as they had appeared. However, the land that had been beyond was obviously and irrevocably changed. Some zones looked twisted as if the original landscape had been poorly merged with some alien place. Others looked as if many years had passed, but the flora observed was nothing known to Earth. At first it seemed as if all the people who had been trapped beyond were dead, but soon survivors started stumbling past the boundary with no memory of the past week.\n\nWith them some stars returned, but they were not the stars that had been there before. These were new and unknown stars.\n\nPeople who were sent into the strange zones either died in inexplicable ways or went murderously and destructively insane. With the clear boundaries and alien landscapes the zones came to be called Gates. Seeing that they were harmful governments and corporations acted quickly around the world to contain the toxic borders.\n\nThe people who survived the initial Gate phenomena started to display strange behaviors at first and later the ability to do things that defied our very understanding of the world. In a word they had magic. These were the first Espers to walk the world. They were often unstable and none of them fully integrated with their abilities.\n \nSome of them died in the early days.  Through uncontrolled use of their abilities, murder, or collapsing into schismed personalities.  Every time an Esper died one of the new stars vanished.\n \nStudy of a connection between the Gates, the new stars, and the Espers began in earnest.\n\nWhat was found was that these Espers had a connection to the Gates as well. They were able to enter them with no ill effects. They were also able to bring back things from the other side. Things that caused a huge jump in technology. A new technology emerged that combines magic and technology, called magitek.\n\nSeen as valuable assets Espers were rounded up by governments and corporations. To this day Espers belong to either a corporation or to a government.\n\nWith the aid of magitek telescopes it was found that every Esper had their own star. From it could be gleaned the power of an Esper and if they were using their power or not. This became a tool in finding and containing Espers.\n\nEventually some children started being born along with new stars. As they aged they displayed the powers of an Esper. They were dubbed the \"second wave\" and those that emerged from the Gates \"first wave.\" The naming convention has stayed even as the years passed.\n\n*You will all be playing second wave Espers that are part of the Farlight Foundation. A large corporation situated in upstate New York. New York city is now the host of two partly overlapping Gates. Farlight Foundation works primarily with the phenomena of those Gates.*\n\n*In basic terms Espers have elemental powers and some have mixed elements that lead to interesting powers. I've covered them all as they are known, but if you have an idea please do share. I am also rather sparse on Strengths and Weaknesses. I hit a blank so absolutely feel free to come up with something awesome.*\n\n*Not covered in the blip above is Urge. All Espers have one. It is like another being inside of an Esper. A being that their powers flow from. It also seems to exert some influence over the behavior of  the Esper. Second wave Espers are more in sync having grown up with the influence. How active and sentient you'd like your Urge to be is up to you.*", "name": "Darker Skies"}

They are not in search of a new home, nor do they have any hope of finding intelligent life outside of their own species. In 1500 years of searching, they have found no evidence of either and most humans now believe that they are alone in the universe.\n\nThe Holy Sea is the theocratic order that governs humanity and encourages its continued spread across the universe. The order is named for a long-forgotten power in humanity's history which is understood to have worshiped the Earth's oceans. If humans are truly unique in creation, the Holy Sea believes it is their duty to explore every inch of the universe and to find God in so doing. Exploration and constant motion are valued above all other principles.\n\nWhile the Holy Sea is relatively tolerant of non-believers (as long as they are still willing to abide by the law), they have recently become concerned that the Colonist movement is gaining support among humans at the fringes of explored space. The Colonists believe that a habitable planet does exist and will be discovered, allowing humanity to once again live together on the ground.\n\n**OOC Information**\n\n*Setting*: Humans have not lived on solid ground in over 1500 years. All characters would have lived their lives either on spaceships or space stations, or a combination of the two. In general, living on a space station for any long stretch of time is frowned upon, as the ideal is to be on a ship exploring. Life on a space station, however, is far more comfortable than life on a spaceship.\n\n*Religion*: Adherents of the Holy Sea believe in the existence of a god and also believe that humanity is alone in the universe. Non-believers are still ruled over by the Holy Sea, and are not treated substantially differently, nor do they have fewer rights. Most non-believers think that either intelligent life and/or a new home planet exists and we haven't found it yet, or they believe that we are alone but that this does not prove the existence of a god.\n\n*World-building*: This is a loose framework and you are encouraged to build upon it. The only set rules for the world are those I have outlined above, so if you want to create new places or history to fit the characters you create, please feel free to do so.

Legends and myths differ, but one thing they all agree on is this - demons are corrupt life forms that seek destruction and attempt to meet their own ends at the cost of everyone else's. And demons cannot be destroyed, only scattered and imprisoned. So as the demons were spawned so many centuries ago, so the Shadow Void was born of the determination, studies and power of the mages of that age. An alternate dimension of shadow, perfect for sealing the demons in for all eternity. Four keys were created, each one passed to one of the ruling members of the city's council to safeguard. So long as there was someone left to guard the Gateway, the demons would never be free to wreak havoc en masse.\n\nUntil now.\n\nTwo of the Gatekeepers have fallen, one poisoned at his dinner table and one found dead in his bed. Rumours are already circulating that there are demons on the prowl once again. Somehow, somewhere, there has been a breach in the Shadow Void, and the demons have escaped. And though it is only in small numbers now, two of the keys are gone - missing. Only two remain. Two keys and two Council members, standing in the way of the demon horde. The Hunters have been recalled to stand before the Council. To investigate and to stop this from happening - before the city becomes a slaughtering ground. \n________________________________________________\nThe Shadow Gateway is an urban fantasy mystery, where players will investigate the disappearance of the keys to unlock the Shadow Void. While I have some ideas as to where the plot might go, I am generally open to ideas and will do my best to work with what is given so long as it's not totally out of the park. The story also has a definite ending, though it's not set in stone exactly what the ending *is*. \n\nPlayers will be Hunters in the same team sent out by the Council to investigate this mystery.

Standing for a thousand years, the one hundred and forty-four crystalline columns represented the twelve months and the twelve muses... or so they said before its destruction.  When the first foundations were laid, the temple was for the goddess Ersloiene, and there were one hundred and forty-three columns, for the thirteen moon-months and the eleven passions.  That-\n\n\"Oh.  I see.  It is not *history* you are interested in, but a tale?  Not learning, but entertainment?  A shame... what, then?  Something noble and uplifting...?  No?  Something bold and bloody?  That is thirsty work, then, and my cup is empty.\n\n\"The wine will do... so.  There were many tales, bold and bloody, that were told of the times after the Age of Crystal, when the cities of the Mage-Kings were shattered, when both Gods and Demons were driven out of the mortal world... the flying city of Aelzo had fallen on top of the Jyau'thur, known as the City of Scholars, and much was lost.  The Great Empire of Conarlu, which once spanned the northern lands from sea to sea was shattered into a hundred squabbling fiefdoms... then only two score when the dead began to walk again.  The Knights of the Holy Fire were disbanded, and the Summoner Lords of the Spider Islands paid their final blood price... \n\n\"The Age of Crystal, the age of high magic, of great deities and devils, had passed.  The world was shattered by the collapse of the great magics, and then fed upon by the vultures and the fearful who tore apart the remaining shreds.  The Blessed Tree of Life in Pranthalithivlaristh - which kept illness and disease at bay in the the city since it was founded - was stripped of its fruit and seed so that one warlord's army could defy death for a single day.  And the tree burned afterwards to prevent anyone else from ever doing so -  though there are tales that a solder kept a seed rather than eating it, and later stole away with it to a far away land...  Like the tales of the Demon Lord of the Pit of the Black Flame.  The clerics of Ghalyunri paid a terrible price of sacrifice, but summoned him simultaneously to over a thousand summoning circles and shattered him.  Each fragment was battled and destroyed... they claimed.  Rumors of one escaping persisted...\n\n\"The world tottered uncertainty in the gap between Ages.  No one knew if history would once again swing towards an Age of Magic, or if it would be one of Steel and Blood.  The tribes of the jungles of Imarland grew bold, bidding to make it an Age of Voodoo.  But even deeper in the jungle, the spirits of the ancient beasts stirred, sensing a chance to not merely end the Age of Magic, but the Era of Man... and among all this chaos, there were those who strove to be noble heroes among the madness.\n\n\"Alas for the time, they tended to be shorted-lived.  And those are not the tales you want to hear... so, then, a tale of scoundrels and mayhem and adventure, in that gap of history, before the world steadied and a new Age started...\n\n-------\nNarrator notes: Don't expect a lot of images.  I'd rather spend time on the writing than hunting down appropriate and usable visuals.  While an image may be worth a thousand words, I'd rather see good writing.\n\nThe inspirations are: Conan, Frazetta's Death Dealer, Fafhrd and the Grey Mouser, Thundarr the Barbarian, Beastmaster, cheap pulp fantasy, Thieves World (novels) etc.  Some amount of influence from things like Mad Max, the A-Team, and Cowboy Bebop (the anime series) - the main characters will be scoundrels mostly trying to survive and find some sort of fortune (and/or fame) in an age of chaos, but perhaps end up helping others while in the process of lining their own purses.  At least until they spend it all in debauchery and start over.  \n\nThe game will likely be NSFW and potentially full of stuff that triggers issues for some.  By that I mean, given the inspirations and settings, there could be scenes of loincloth-clad barbarians rescuing mostly-to-completely naked princes(ses) by beheading dozens of beast-men in a ocean of gore, followed by a certain amount of celebratory debauchery.  Not very politically correct or sensitive.  That said, it is not intended to be a story of Gor, though slaver traders, beast-men raiding villages to carry off the virgins, etc. could certainly be part of it.  The focus should hopefully be on the adventuring bit.\n\nAlso, while, hopefully, the characters won't get killed off, there will be the possibility of abuse, torture, branding as a thief, molestation to various levels, etc. - consider the Conan movies, in which the character is enslaved left for the vultures, etc.  So it would not be out of genre if Bad Things are threatened at the characters, particularly if they get caught.  Whether the threats are followed through with on camera, so to speak, will probably depend on the player mix.  It should be kept in mind that the setting is essentially post-apocalyptic in many ways, and even in places that seem civilized, the veneer of civilization tends to be crumbling into decadence, ruthlessness, or both.\n\nThat said, ultimately the camera focus should be on adventuring, swashbuckling, and some humor, not so much on the dark stuff.  \n\nCharacters should be human.  True magic, as opposed to trickery and slight of hand, is increasingly rare.  While characters may have magic abilities, they should be non-epic in scope.  Flashy magic will tend to get a lot of notice.  In general, characters ought to be able to, at most, deal with, say, 5 villagers, 3 thugs/town militia, 1-2 guards/soldiers/slavers, or, maybe, 1 well-trained/elite guard/soldier, under the right circumstances (i.e. ambush, etc).  This might be through fast talk, fleeing, combat, whatever.  If the character concept can behead all of the town militia or fast talk an entire squad of elite guards, then it is probably out of scope.  (i.e. no glass cannon/nukes, either.)  However, the characters working together might be a different story (and hopefully an entertaining one.)  This is not to say the characters won't get better as time goes on, but to give scope for the start.\n\nThe characters do not need to have a pure heart of gold, but they shouldn't be irredeemable, either.   They should have some sort of positive qualities.\n\nThe story settings will probably meander between some city-states of various sizes and local law enforcement, to smaller towns and villages, and some wilderness.  The exact mix will probably vary depending on how things go.\n\nMechanics-wise, feel free to create your own cards, though at the moment we need a thief-type and a muscle-type to round things out I think - or someone willing to take over Vlordraam.  I am not particularly obsessed with Strength vs. Weakness cards - that is, I can be convinced to let people play a Strength as a Weakness or vice versa (i.e. a Strength of 'Attractive' or 'Charming' might be a weakness if one is trying not to be the one the slavers pick, and conversely a Weakness of 'Hideously Scarred' might be a Strength in that situation.)", "name": "Lacunae of the Ages"}

The super heroes who stop villains from melting the world, the super heroes who save burning buses from explodified bridges, even the heroes who save a few astronauts.\n\nYou are **not** these heroes. You are the super powered citizens that no one mentions. You are the one with \"lame\" powers. Powers like converting any liquid into soda, or the power to produce video game noises. Small, and *not* noteworthy. You are just trying to make it through life.\n\nThe daily life of being not-so-super powered has lead you to go to Supers Anonymous (S.A., Super Anon). That will be your first scene and your get-to-know-one-another-thing-a-ma-bob. This will be the site of a majority of scenes as it's the only place you all come together.\n\n**Character Creation Notes:**\nYour nature should be your occupation (it can be custom but my approval will be tight on those. No being rich, that's cheating), your strength should most likely reflect your power. Your weakness and sub plot will be left to you. Note your power can be a weakness as well but be warned, that is a slippery slope. Also, no secret identities. You are a normal person besides the power bit. \n\n**Gameplay Notes:**\nI'm more of a player than a narrator but I thought this could be fun. So bear with me. Also I REALLY want this to be CHARACTER driven and REAL. So get into it, feel what your character feels. Oh and form relationships! Romantic, platonic, enemy, whatever you want. Just keep swearing in check (you can swear but try to use other words too) and as much as we all love smut, keep it off screen. Kissing, groping might be allowed at my discretion. Depends. Characters can drink but I believe in drunkedness. I reserve the right to request revisions if they act too sober.\n\nThe style is, each week at Super Anon, the current chairman will give the group a task to complete in the week before the next meeting. Your moves should be you completing these. They're weeks won't line up with RL times. Some will be one scene weeks, some may be a chapter. We'll have to see! Working with other players per goal is encouraged! Remember: Relationships are key and I'll reward player interaction.\n\nHeavy role playing focus. Avatar pictures are the only ones I require.\n\nLastly, we may have scenes where there are no Super Anon challenges  but rather the challenges of life. Feel free to team up on these too, realistically.\n\n**Setting Notes:**\nHere and now in an alternate generic city. It will be named Metatropeapolis. Yes that is Meta-Trope-Opolis. I'm mocking the stereotypical Metropolis. Backstories can be anything as long as they end with you going to S.A. The mood should be light and sit-comical with splashes of drama.\n\n**Places you may include in backstory:**\n\n*Doomsday Coffee House* - Coffee house across the street from Super Anon\n\n*Super Anon* - More than just a support group, it is also a small business run out of a small office building.\n\n*Green Dale Park* - A large park about two blocks from Super Anon. It's big and has a few small carts and vendors.\n\n*Hobo Joe's* - A bar next to Super Anon. Not the most \"legal\" joint around but full of (basically) good people.\n\n*Metatropeapolis University* - Top notch education and top notch parties are only a short bus ride away from Super Anon and conveniently found in the same place.\n\n*Morbread Bakery* - A hip little bakery with death and gore themed treats. Their signature items are crumpled little rolls with cherries and raspberries called Wounds. \"Morbread Bakery, where the Wounds are always fresh!\"", "name": "Average, Ordinary, Everyday, Super Hero"}

It is literally possible for teenagers to buy cybernetics now with pocket money, even including the cost of the surgery needed to put it in. The Nister Corporation owner, Valeria Cumae has donated many complex cybernetics not only to war veterans, but also to average people, and has installed a number of them on herself. However, a notorious group of anti-cybernetic activists, known as the brotherhood of Sinew, have begun publishing reports that there are severe consequences from allowing the Nister Corporation's cybernetics to be installed. Most have been definitively disproven, but there is a definite level of public fear. \n\nIt is up to the heroes to learn what they can about both groups and take a side in the public contraversy.

Once the beating heart of the Rosdin Robotics Corporation, Tear now lies abandoned in the wake of a deadly plague which forced the city's inhabitants to seek shelter in the chaos and lawlessness of post-democratic America. But although humanity has deserted Tear, the city is far from dead: for, in the wake of disaster, Rosdin's world-famous robotics survives.\n\nFollowing the Great Market Fallout, Tear was built to be the world's first self-sustaining city, complete with underground farming facilities, fully-automated recycling depots, and rehabilitation centres for criminals, madmen, and defective robots. The megacorp's secret weapon to realize this? The Empathy Matrix - a precise blend of programming and circuitry which allows for sentient thought patterns and emotion in robots. An Empathy Matrix can be found in every Rosdin robot, and it is by way of these deceptively simple chips that Rosdin obliterated rival companies Shigu Enterprises and Taylen Corp. Though Empathy Matrices do not allow for exact duplication of sapient thought, everyone in America knows that Rosdin's automatons are not mere machines; they are true Artificial Intellects.\n\nNow, with the loss of their greatest achievement, the Rosdin Corporation is in shambles. But you - poor, lost soul, you - do not know of this. Nor do you care.\n\nFor something is awakening the robots within Tear. Something subtle. Something that will shake the foundations of the world for years to come.\n\nAnd you are its next target.\n\n==========================================\n\nIn this campaign, players will take the identities of various robots within the abandoned city of Tear. Your characters will be, in essence, human, save for their lack of inner organs, flesh, nerves, etc.; take this into account when you act, as it's unlikely your character will feel pain (though warning sensors will likely activate) or emotions akin to a human's.\n\nYou'll begin in a factory somewhere in Tear as the newest recipients of the Awakening Virus - a strange disease which changes the programming of robots' Empathy Matrices and fully activates their sapient programming. Though only Rosdin-built robots are created with Empathy Matrices, don't be afraid to choose a different manufacturer, so long as you can explain their presence within the city - perhaps as a research tool, perhaps as some mechanic's toy. Non-Rosdin AI can succumb to the Virus as well (more on this in-game).\n\nLooking for 4-5 players, preferably. I encourage you all to create your own Natures, Strengths, and Weaknesses.

{"id": "1a48dc32-dbac-4af7-a71c-eab15c22fb41", "premise": "The year is 2070 AD. Since the early 2020s, the world has been changed by the appearance of individuals with abilities beyond those of normal humans. People with command over fire and ice, people with the power to read and control minds, people who flew through the air and shrugged off gunfire. Individuals with a seemingly endless variety of powers appeared in greater and greater numbers all across the world.\n\nSome of these people were the products of science, either granted powers by accident or through intentional human experimentation. Others were simply born with their abilities with no obvious explanation. Scientists continue to debate the source of these abilities, with no clear consensus having yet been reached.\n\nWhatever the source of these superpowered individuals, it was only a tragically short amount of time before many of them turned to crime. So-called 'supervillainy' became a worldwide epidemic as non-powered law enforcement proved helpless to stop this new breed of criminal.\n\nFortunately, just as many powered individuals proved willing to step up and defend their communities against this menace. Vigilantes took to the streets in costumes and masks, fighting against criminals that law enforcement was unable to stop. While these individuals were highly controversial at first, governments worldwide began to realize that powered crime fighters were the only ones capable of protecting the public in this new age.\n\nThus began the careers of the first superheroes. Government agencies began to offer official sponsorship to certain heroes who had proven themselves as defenders of their communities. Teams of powered individuals increasingly replaced mundane law enforcement in cities across the globe. Most major urban centers now have at least one officially recognized team of heroes tasked with defending the people against all manner of villainy. Many of them still wear costumes like the vigilantes of old out of respect for tradition.\n\nOf course, not all 'heroes' have taken on the role of a crime fighter out of a selfless desire to do good. Powered individuals are still in short supply, and government agencies will pay handsomely to get the best of the best on their side. Corporations increasingly offer sponsorship to superhero teams, placing their logos on their costumes and equipment in exchange for large cash contributions. Superheroes feature prominently in many major national advertising campaigns. Some of the most prominent heroes are among the most wealthy and famous people alive today. This includes the Justice Squad, the famed protectors of Champion City, a metropolis on the east coast of the United States\n\nYou aren't one of those heroes. You have no corporate sponsors. You have no government contract. You are what many might call a 'C-list hero'. You probably have a day job of some sort, and might just be scraping by to make ends meet. Still, the Justice Squad can't be everywhere in Champion City. You might just be doing what you can to stop petty street crime for now, but who knows? The opportunity to make it into the big leagues might be right around the corner.\n\nOOC INFORMATION:\n\nI'm aiming to tell a sort of 'classic' superhero story here. It won't be a hundred percent dark and gritty, but it won't be entirely comedic or silly either. Think Batman: The Animated Series as an example of the sort of tone here. There will be plenty of action scenes battling supervillains and other criminals, but there will also be non-action based scenes dealing with the other difficulties of life as a superhero.\n\nFeel free to draw from classic superhero tropes. Capes, masks, and silly costumes are fine. Backstories can range from tragic to mildly ridiculous. Secret identities are common in the setting, and you can feel free to have both a 'hero name' and a regular name.\n\nYou are welcome to use either the provided cards for natures, strengths, weaknesses, and subplots, or to create your own custom cards. Feel free to add art.\n\nAll characters will start as unaffiliated 'C-list' heroes who are unconnected with an established team or organization. They will be given a reason to start working together fairly quickly in the first scene.\n\nPlease include some description of your character's powers and abilities in your application, along with a brief origin story to explain how they got them.\n\nI will be looking for a group of 3-6 players.

The priestess sings a song in a language that was dead long before the first syllables of Latin were uttered on this Earth.

Well, it is one of five Covenants... major political/religious factions among the undead in a little tabletop RPG by the name of *Vampire: The Requiem*... \n\nwhat does the Circle of the Crone believe? They believe that vampires are the apex predators in the grand food chain of this world, and therefore, they should not have to feel any shame about what they do... do most humans shed a tear for the plate of fried chicken they are about to devour in order to satisfy their hunger? Of course not.\n\nThe Circle of the Crone is also a gestalt, a heady and seductive melange of various occult belief systems... both ancient and modern, and all so very different in exact beliefs... but there is one thing they have in common, they represent cults and covens and other such groups that have been persecuted through the centuries now banded together.\n\nThis short story, which I have crafted to help test out some new Storium features will be focusing on the Circle of the Crone, specifically, on a recruitment ritual I concocted... and partially based on certain passages from a propbook originally written for *Vampire: The Masquerade*... which book is that? Why, *Revelations of the Dark Mother* of course... which I believe is where the Circle of the Crone truly began in the World of Darkness (new and old).\n\nFor the purposes of this game, you will all begin as mortals... some of you may have been training and preparing for this ritual for the last several years of your life, eager to prove yourself worthy of the Dark Gift that the Crones have promised you if you complete your training... others of you are simply hapless fools that wandered where they shouldn't have... or whom the Crones abducted to throw in a few wild cards into the proceedings.\n\nFor character creation, I have set up a few **Nature** cards that are based around certain broad personality archetypes. You are free to pick from any of them, or none of them... just keep in mind that if you make a nature, please try to keep it thematically appropriate. Thank you.\n\nAs for **Strengths and Weaknesses**... well the new way Storium handles things makes them a bit more flexible so go ahead and make them anything you want... except for weapons or magic or powers of any sort... as those you do not have as mere mortals... and even if you were a police officer or a soldier or a trained assassin or whatever... you will not have any weapons to go in there with you.\n\nLastly... your **Subplot** should reflect why you are even at the initiation ceremony to begin with... are you a mortal cultist eagerly waiting her chance to prove herself and gain eternal life at the end of this trial you have spent years readying yourself for? Or were you simply at the wrong place at the wrong time and are hopelessly confused? Or have you been watching the Crones' \"Nest\" for some time and have been trying to connect the dots? Or anything else that might work.\n\nJust keep in mind... that if you are a cultist that has been a part of this group for years... your character is going to be female.

And if you succeed\u2026 you will finally be worth something. Your life will finally be yours.\n\nHello my fellow Storium players! This story is going to have three separate paths. The Escape, The Rescue, and The Retrieval. Players who choose to be a Glade Child will be able to choose any mythical creature (within reason). Near the start of the game, I will randomly divide you into the Escape and Rescue groups. You might end up captured or freed at some point in the game and change over to the other group.\n\nThe Retrieval path is the path you will take if you choose to be a Hunter. No matter what, your mission will be to retrieve the magical creatures and bring them back to your home to make a place for yourself in the crumbling outside world. Perhaps, further in, you might even have a change of heart\u2026\n\nThe Story:\n\nFor thousands of years, The Glade has been protected and watched over by an ancient, mythical being called the Gladekeeper. He has preserved all he could of the world of magic and kept it secret and separate from the world we humans know, creating a safe haven for all magical creatures to exist within.\n\nEventually, magic simply died out in our world. Those who chose to exist outside the Glade grew extinct and those without magic, the human race, grew to forget it even existed. With the Glade sealed off by Gladekeeper\u2019s magic, it was impossible for it to be discovered again.\n\nYears into the future, in 2046 to be exact, the world fell into war and chaos. Most of humanity was wiped out. Those left were drafted into a life of military service. Decades passed as the world crumbled, and soon generations were born that did not know life outside of working for the \u201cpreservation of mankind.\u201d As the world leaders continued to try and destroy each other, the countries became isolated war cities. The Glade, through all of this, remained unspoiled and unaware.\n\nAfter hundreds of years, technology had regressed rather than advanced. With the loss of entire civilization and the internet, thousands of years of knowledge and progress were lost. Eventually, different kinds of technology emerged. Soon, the humans learned how to harness the energies of the earth, an arcane power, we\u2019d best understand as magic.\n\nBut like anything, magic became a coveted resource. Because of their ability to detect it, The Glade was no longer hidden from their greedy eyes. Magic there was strong and primal, having existed and flourished there for millennia. And the creatures that lived there were bursting with it. It soon became a target, as well as all the beings within it.\n\nWhen humanity attacked, The Gladekeeper was killed. And everything the Glade Children had ever known was destroyed without remorse. This is where our story begins\u2026\n\n---\n\nFor your Character:\n\nYou must pick one of the two Natures, but please *expand* on it with your backstory. \n\nI will give you some Strength/Weakness/ Goal cards as examples.

He who strikes a blow to rescue the Holy Sepulchre from the pollution of the unbelievers has thrown open the door of heaven for himself.\"\n-Peter the Hermit\n\nIt is the year 1171, between the Second and Third Crusades. Nearly a hundred years have passed since Pope Urban called for holy war at Clermont and the gathered crowds responded: \"God wills it!\"  The Western residents of the Crusader states have managed to establish stable settlements throughout the length of the Levant, though raids by local mountain tribes and the Seljuqs to the East continue to threaten pilgrims to the Holy Land. To the south, the last Fatimid caliph has fallen to the new Sultan of Egypt: Saladin. King Amalric has journeyed to Constantinople to request Byzantium's help against the increasingly united forces of the Saracens, but no help is coming. Already, Saladin's forces have begun to claim territory in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. \n\nEven here, thirty miles north of the Sea of Galilee, the news is clear: war will come again to the Holy Land. \n\nAtop the summit of a rocky mountain, a hard day's journey east from the major roads that run south to Jerusalem, the modest fortress of Domus Boni Latronis stands near the frontier of Crusader territory. Allegedly, it marks the birthplace of the Good Thief, who was crucified alongside Jesus but repented before his death. Now, it is a lesser-known pilgrimage site for desperate sinners seeking redemption as well as the headquarters of a small garrison of Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, known to most as the Templars.\n\nFort Latronis seems an odd place to house a squadron of Christendom's elite warriors in these uncertain times. The frontier is a dangerous place, and the Templars are dedicated to the protection of pilgrims, certainly... but the site is so obscure, its location so isolated. The Templars' vows of obedience discourage active questioning of their leaders, so they continue their daily routines of praying, escorting pilgrims, and maintaining their readiness to battle the Saracens.\n\nIt will soon become clear that there is something older and far more malevolent  in these mountains than Mohammedans. Something that the Order hopes to harness as a weapon in the war for the Holy Land-- if it does not destroy them all, Christian and Saracen alike.\n\n---\n\nFor more information on character creation, visit the forum thread in Looking for Players: https://storium.com/forums#/category/lfp/thread/h4rtq8", "name": "At the Door of Heaven"}

Mangled and torn up corpses began washing up on the banks the river. The Temple of Shadow has been known to use human sacrifices in the past so fingers were quickly pointed at the Shadow Priests. Upon investigation, nothing was found. \n\nAs the months went by more and more bodies were being found and not just in the river. Soon more victims were being found in the alleys and streets of Luminous' western districts, the slums of the bright city. The western district lies across the Kalaka river that runs north to south through the city. Its taverns, brothels, bars and shabby housing sprawl out from the western bank of the river. Most of those found among the dead were human Gravitiri, the working class population of the city, but corpses of some  aristocratic Levitiri began cropping up as well. Because of the brutal and bloody nature of the killings, voices began crying out against the non-human races of the city. Some Raegai, a lupine humanoid race from the southeast, and Ursai, a great Bear-like bipedal race from the north, were trialed and executed for the murders at the testimony and witness of humans; but the numbers of dead found didn't cease. Only one thing linked the murders together: the bodies were discovered in the highest numbers at the dawn after a full moon.\n\nRumours of lycanthropy spread through the city like wildfire. People of the western district flocked to the Temple of Light to plead with the Hierophant for help. As the head of both the church and state they hoped He would provide a miraculous solution to their monstrous problem. Their pleas however fell empty on his ears. The Church simply released a volunteer application for extra guards to be on duty at night. After some of the guards in the western district disappeared, not many other volunteered. \n\n The Temple of Shadow issued Black Knights, the temple's personal guard, to being patrolling the streets on the nights that one of the moons was full. This however, did not improve the situation. Mobs soon began to form in the streets at night, fueled by religious zealots looking to purge the city of the unclean plague brought upon the city. Extreme racism for half-human or non-human races in the city was already very common, but now the people are being stirred to violence. \n\nWith the Church and State not being willing to aid the commonfolk of the city and more and more deaths occurring closer to the centre of the city where the Levitiri reside, what can be done about this rising problem? Some seek to eradicate the problem, others to find a cure. Some are trying to find the source of the lycanthropy and proverbially cut off the head of the snake. Whatever happens must happen quickly or the city will soon fall into chaos. \n\n\u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u2014\n\nThrough this story I hope to explore issues of racism, patriarchy, xenophobia and tyranny through intolerance while keeping it fun and exciting for the characters. \n\nThe setting of the story is an alternate late nineteenth century urban environment.

French journalist Jean-Phillippe Rousseau wrote many of these stories appearing as fiction and journalism providing insight as one of Jack's confederates. \n\nMany claim the disparity between the fiction and the fact to be based on Snow's delusional nature, many kiss and tell stories published detailed Snow's scars which he claimed to have gotten fighting Yeti and on the occasions he participated in high society functions he insisted on made up titles such as \"Warden of Taselori\" and \"Master of the Five Rings of Singuel\" to be used.  Still the files of the NYPD show that he spent his millions to fund crime fighting that otherwise wouldn't have been achieved whatever else he was up to. \n\nSince 1938 when Snow, Rousseau and the confederates' ace pilot Buck Randall left for Australia on \"urgent business\" little has been heard of them. Randall returned to the states to join the air force during World War 2 becoming a Colonel, other than that Rousseau has sent infrequent correspondence detailing time spent in  the Himilayas, the African heartlands and the coasts of South America often detailing new Confederates who have aided them but the lack of public profile has left Jack Snow and his Confederates of the Extraordinary a faded memory cherished by only the few who served and shared only to those who are trusted. \n\nThe year is 1960 and Jean-Phillippe Rousseau is dead. Invites to his funeral have made their way to many of those associated with his adventures despite 8 years without word. What better pretext could there be for a reunion of the Confederates of the Extraordinary?\n\n*Narrators note.*\n*You'll be playing either a Confederate or someone associated with a Confederate (a child, grand child, trusted lab assistant) who could be viewed as a \"Legacy\" member of the group. Not all Confederates would know each other, you may have met with Jack and Jean-Phillippe during their 20s Manhattan hayday or their subsequent adventures. You could even know Jack (or be associated with someone who knew Jack) before he came to public prominence (sometime between 1891 and 1910) if you want to.*\n\n*There are a number of cards on offer but feel free to make up your own. I'm ideally looking for a mixture of old hands and young guns character wise, those who've been through adventures in the past and those who know of the adventures. This is my first time narrating so bare with me as I learn the tricks of the trade.*", "name": "Whatever happened to Jack Snow and the confederates of the extraordinary? (clone)"}

Each story is meant to keep the people of Coteras away from the Demonkin and the demons whom blood they share. However, for the past few hundred years, the world has forgotten about the existence of these Demonkin and thought only of these people as though they were stories. Nothing more. So the fables became more beloved by children, stories of heroism and greatness for heroes who had slain the demons which tried to take Coteras.\n\nAs a member of the Grey, you've been with your leader, a woman who goes by the title Seer and predicts events of the future. Her own visions have become full of dread and panic. Fire raining on the green hills of Coteras. From the deserts came a god of old, one who roamed the world in times of dark. From the legends of the demons: Asmodeus. From what the Seer can see, this god will be brought back with the help of five people. Among these five are those of legend: Demonkin. These five will cause the world to go into chaos, ending Coteras.\n\nYou, along with others, have been invited to the Seer's room for a mission which will hopefully stop the end of the world. Your journey will be long and perilous, filled with laughs and tears, but what will happen at the end of this adventure? Will you be seen as the saviors of all the life on Coteras, or will you bring the ruin upon what was once a plentiful world?\n\nDestiny will be shaped by your actions.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThis game is high fantasy with minimal technology. The only land to ever devise any high technology is Dederia, which have become a somewhat steampunk-like society. If you wish to try and use some technology, by all means, but please explain how such things would work in a universe where people do not know much about science.\n\nMagic exists in Coteras. If you character is to use magic, please explain how this magic works. If you would like a system or have no idea for one, feel free to ask for one. I would, however, prefer you had an idea of how your own magic worked for your character. Adds more depth to who he or she is.\n\nAs far as the world, Coteras is divided into three human kingdoms. The first is the Xillian Empire, an empire which finds that culture is the most prized possession for any man to gain. The Xillian people love art in any form and love looking at civilizations long since forgotten. The Gregorian Empire is a land of people who believe that strength is the key to happiness. All the Gregorian people look to make themselves stronger than the other human empires and, in all else, more powerful than their neighboring civilizations. The last empire, the Dederian empire, looks to make their scholar's the most brilliant in the world. The people of Dederia love to invent new things and hardly ever rely on magic for their creations.\n\nYou can come from these empires or from wherever you wish on their lands, but you will begin in a neutral territory.

{"id": "339d846c-1713-4cd9-921c-b046eb10f6f2", "premise": "*The purpose of this game is to serve as a test for the battle mechanism being developed for the \"Roman Storium\" series of games.  It will consist of just a few scenes, centered (very loosely) around the \"Jewish War\" of the late First Century AD.*\n\nThe Game will consist of three \"Acts:\"\n\n**Act I:  The Uprising.**  In June 66 A.D., the depredations of Gessius Florus, Imperial Rome\u2019s Procurator in Jerusalem, had driven an already desperate Judean populace into open revolt.  Judean freedom-fighters, many of whom were secretly armed for quite some time, rallied to their respective factions leaders.\n\n**Act II:  The Assault of Gallus.**  During the early weeks of the rebellion, Legio XII \u201cFulminata\u201d force-marches to their beleaguered comrades aid from off-map under leadership of Rome\u2019s Syrian Provincial Governor, Cestius Gallus. (Note: this scene is a hypothetical scenario; it never happened in real history).\n\n\n**Act III:  Titus Flavius Vespasianus.**  The battle presented in Act III will be the full-on assault of three full-strength Roman legions, to include the much vaunted Tenth.  \n\n*Source Material:  \"The Siege of Jerusalem: Scenarios\" By Fred Schachter*\n-----------------------------------------\n\n**EXPERIMENTAL RULES.**  \n\n These will be Player vs. Player (PVP) battles.  In situations where the fight is Player vs. Narrator, the same general rules will apply, with the exception that the number of boxes in the Battle Challenge Card would be halved.  *(For this game, the Narrator will be controlling one of the belligerent Players, but that would not need be the case in future games.*\n\n  The tactical problem to be addressed will be presented in the form of a **\"Battle Challenge Card\"** (BCC).  A BCC will consist of a basic description of the battle to be fought, with additional details being provided by the Narrator in the Scene Description.  The BCC will include the **Initial Combat Odds** (ICO).  The ICO describe the odds (based on a 100-sided die roll) of a battle having a specific outcome.  The ICO will be presented on the BCC from the perspective of the Roman Player (i.e., if ICO says \"Roman Defeat,\" then the corresponding opposite conclusion (\"Enemy Victory\") is implied.  \n\nA typical BCO for a Battle Challenge Card might read something like:\n**Initial Combat Odds:\nVictory: 1-40\nDraw: 41-70\nDefeat: 71-95\nUtter Rout: 96-100**\n\n  In determining the ICO, the Narrator will take into account (at a minimum) the following factors:\n - Size differentials (if any) of the opposing forces\n - Training and Equipment\n - Morale\n - Supply Status\n - Effects of Terrain\n - Effects of artillery, missile fire, and cavalry\n - Siege and/or Breaching Assault (Defender in a fort or walled city)\n \nThere is *no* hard & fast rule for how these factors will affect the BCO (i.e., \"cavalry advantage = 5 points\").  Rather the Narrator (whom you just gotta trust!) will arbitrarily \"take these factors into account\" when deciding how the BCO numbers will be adjusted as the battle is being designed.  (Hint:  a battle with clean 50-50 odds may prove to be a rarity.) \n\n  Actions of both combatants will have an influence on the battle's outcome; these will be expressed in terms of **Combat Modifiers** (CMs) applied to the computer-generated die roll (DR).  From an algebraic standpoint, CMs favoring the Roman will be subtracted from the roll; those favoring the opponent/enemy will be added.  \n\n Here's an initial (though not all-inclusive) list of Combat Modifiers:\n**Strength Card:** -5 (Roman)/+5 (Opponent)\n**Weakness Card:** +5 (Roman)/-5 (Opponent)\n**Military Asset Card:**  +15/-15\n**Economic Asset Card:**  +10/-10\n**\"Generic\"(but somehow appropriate) Asset Card:**  +1/-1\n**\"Generic\" (and totally inappropriate) Asset Card:**  -1/+1\n**Subplot and Goal Cards:**  Use the same general rule as for Asset Cards \n\nAn example of a Military Asset Card would be \"Praefectus Fabrum\" (Military Engineer).  Playing this card would have prove quite effective in just about any combat situation. \n\nGenerals occasionally gave *Donatives* in the form of cash gifts to their troops on the eve of battle to boost morale and stiffen resolve.  A Player with a \"Major Financial Expenditure\" Card could use it as an example of an Economic Asset. \n\nThe Narrator will have some leeway in determining the appropriateness of non-military Asset, Subplot, and Goal cards.  A card titled \"Make a Name for Yourself in the Legions\" would be appropriate, and produce the desired effect.  Playing an Asset Card titled \"Pet Peacock\" or a Goal Card titled \"Become a Good Dancer\" would *not.*\n\n  Fill in the Boxes!  You may be asking yourself, \"Why would I *ever* play a Weakness Card on a battle challenge?  If I didn't have enough Strength Cards or good Goal/Subplot Cards available, wouldn't I just not play anything?\"  Great question; we thought of that!  Here's why:  **When the Narrator resolves a battle, any BCC squares left \"blank\" will count as *20 points against* that Player's desired outcome!**  So if it's the eve of the big battle, and you're debating on whether or not to play that Weakness Card titled \"Pees Himself When Frightened,\" just remember that it's a difference of losing 5 points, or losing 20 points!\n\n  Combat Resolution.  A battle will require more than one post for a Player to complete.  The first post may be thought of as either being \"Battle Preparations\" or \"Opening Maneuvers.\"  This is the post where the Player plays his cards against the BCC.  \n\nOnce both participants have expended all their cards, the Narrator will \"do the math\" and determine what the modifiers will be to the combat resolution die roll.  After all the strengths, weaknesses, assets and subplots are played against each other, there will be some net differential, which will be added/subtracted to the computer-aided die roll, which the Narrator now makes.  The roll will be adjusted, and the final number will be compared against the set of outcomes listed on the BCC.  \n\nOnce the Narrator knows the outcome of the battle, he will notify each participant.  It will then be up to the Players to describe how the battle plays out from their perspective.  The Narrator may provide them with little \"bullets\" of information (i.e.,\" Marcus' cavalry feint fails miserably, and the horsemen are cut to pieces\") which the Players can then use in the formation of their posts.\n\n**One Final Note:**  Please keep this important philosophical point in mind:  The object of a game like this isn't \"winning\" or \"losing;\"  the point is to use the battle data to *write a really good story!*  It's all just an opportunity to do some creative writing!  Think of it this way:  If \"The Alamo\" was a Storium game, the Mexican player got the roll he needed to win the battle, but everyone remembers the story the Texican player told describing his glorious defeat!", "name": "The Seige of Jerusalem"}

This  celestial war, waged both in the heavens and the land, took its toll on both the gods and mortals alike, and once it was finished, an age of (needed) peace was ushered in.\n\nIt was during this era that the great cities of the world were born, and humanity flourished. \n\nWhere the story begins:\nThe drums of war have begun to beat. In the heart of the Onyx Mountains, the kingdom of Tana'kus turns its eyes westward, as their aging king plans to expand his empire. He has partnered with the vicious Tenarians, creating a seemingly unstoppable force that threatens all of Ivernia. \n\nYou find yourself in the bustling metropolis of Bellefort. Far from Western capital of Argentia (the only kingdom powerful enough to stand against Tana'kus), your city is the first likely target on the mad king's march.\n\nDo you stand with the free kingdoms, or will you ally yourself with the dark army that sweeps across Ivernia? \n\n\nRaces of Ivernia\n-Humans: The dominant species, making up the biggest of the population in each city\n\n-Dwarf/Haflings: Can be found in most major cities\n\n-Barbarians: A race of incredibly large humans who live a nomadic lifestyle in the Northern Plains where their tribed constantly war against the vile Tenarians. Their skin is thicker than normal humans, providing a natural resistance to the elements. They\n\n-Fae: A race created by the old gods, the immortal fae are almost never seen in modern times. Every fae is aligned to one of the natural elements (Earth/Air/Fire/Water/Sun/Moon), each gifted with unique magics related to their element.  Rumour has it that the Court of the Unseen lays somewhere in the Great Forest in the West of the continent. The Fae do not worship any of the new gods, as they were created by the first pantheon and hold no allegiance to the new gods\n\n-Tenarians: Large, muscular and having 4 arms, the Tenarians are an aggressive race. Not accepted in most cities, they tend to be found in the plains north of the Onyx Mountains\n\nPantheon of Ivernia\n-Argentese: Patron god of Argentia, he hold dominion over justice, protection and light. He often appears as a handsome man, strong of build, with shimmering silver wings and a flaming sword. \n\n-Onaxese: Patron god of Tana'kus, he commands war, strength, battle. His symbol is the axe and appears as a large man with long jet-black hair, a matching beard and eyes that burn like hot embers\n\n-Hekacia: Only remaining god of the Old Pantheon, Hekacia, the Lady of Twilight, is goddess of magic. Her symbol is the Amethyst eye and she appears as a woman of various ages, with a bandage that covers her eyes. \n\n-Septin-Hut: The snake god who rules over thievery, poison, and the desert. Temples to Septin-Hut are few and far between, but his main followers are found in the Southern capital of Calandria, where the thieves guild is largest.\n\n-Stagran: God of the forest and beasts, his followers are usually the druids and rangers of the world. It's prohibited to build temples to Stagran, as worship to this deity is done outdoors. \n\nTBC\n\n\nGeography and places of interest\n\n-Bellefort, The City of 4 Roads: A grand city sitting at the convergence of the 4 great roads: North to the Plains, East to Tana'kus, South to Calandria, and West to Argentia. Bellefort is a free city, run by an elected mayor, and the hub of commerce in Ivernia\n\n-Argentia, The Silver City: A shining beacon of democracy and justice throughout the realm, Argentia is one of the major metropolises of Ivernia. Ruled by an elected council, Argentia is the home of the Silver Knights, a brotherhood sworn to stand up to evil in all it's form, a code that stretches far beyond just the walls of their home city. \n\n-Tana'kus, Located in the heart of the Onyx mountain range, Tana'kus is a bustling, self-sustaining kingdom. Ruled by King Titanese. Borders are strictly controlled by the ever watchful eye of the royal guard. \n\n-The Great Forest: The Great forest spans the majority of the western side of the continent. Largely untouched, it's said that the Court of the Unseen lies somewhere within.\n\n-The Northern Plains: An expansive tundra that dominates the North, the plains are home to the nomadic barbarians (who are mostly found in the North West) and the Tenarian tribes found predominantly to the North East.\n\n-The Amethyst Tower: Located in the mountain range south of Argentia (though impossible to find if you're an unwanted guest), the Amethyst Tower is the beacon of true magic in Ivernia. While priests of Hekacia have set up churches in other major cities, only those truly blessed with real magical talent are admitted to study here. The few that are ever admitted gain the rank of sorcerer/sorceress and wield power far beyond that of normal mages. The Tower is controlled by the Sorcerer Kind or Queen (who is appointed by their predecessor)\n\n\n-The Court of the Unseen: The Fae kingdom located deep in the Great Forest, is surrounded by glamours and charms, making it impossible for mortals to find. It's here that the few remaining fae reside, under the rule of the ruling speakers (one for each element). \n\n-Mistmoore Isles: A dark island off the South Western tip of the continent, few ever venture here. A small fishing village is the only true settlement here, and the townsfolk often speak of the dark horrors that reside in the forest that dominates most of the island. \n\n-Leviathan's Deep: The uncharted ocean off the North Western edge of the continent. No one knows how far it spreads, and tales tell of monstrous sea creatures that dwell in its depths.\n\n", "name": "Tales of Ivernia"}

Oil reserves dwindled, coal seams ran out, forests were depleted, and the water began to rise. Before the first bombs fell it was too late, but that didn't stop the super powers. Wars raged, brief but intense, as the world powers battled over the last few scraps of cheap energy. When the wars ended, no nation was left standing. Those with the money and foresight to hoard resources, build shelters and ride out the storm escaped relatively unscathed. Most of the rest of the population was reduced to scavenging the flooded coasts or scorched plains in order to survive.\n\nNow, the Fall is a distant memory. A handful of super-rich live in enclaves in the temperate climes near the arctic circle, while most of the world slaves away under their yoke. There are places, though. Wild places.

{"id": "f4e18a2f-0329-438a-a09a-e8e36e9e3b69", "premise": "**A film noir story of greed, love, and murder**\n\nThe story is set during World War II in an unnamed American major city, with your characters living in a morally gray world. This gray world is called the underworld. The underworld is where people without morals meet, be they rich or poor, young or old. The people of the underworld have found themselves in situations where there's no easy way out, and where crime and sin might be justifiable. They can be justified as the means to an end for someone who's driven enough, or they can be what life is about for someone with a certain disposition.\n\nIn the underworld there's no clear right and wrong, and almost no one is altogether good or bad. The good policeman takes bribes and plants evidence, while the bad criminal is tortured without revealing his friend's hideout place.\n\nIf your character belongs to high society, he or she is for some reason involved with people of the lower classes. They could for example be a corrupt politician who uses money loaned from gangsters to pay for political campaigns. If your character belongs to the absolute bottom of society, he or she has something to offer people in higher standings. He or she could be a hardboiled private eye who sells dirty services to clients who want things done, but not be connected with him or her.\n\nFilm noir is typically strongly gendered, with male protagonists and female love interests. In this story we forget that, and all Natures are available for both genders.\n\n**Note 1:** The mood is straight film noir, not parody. I don't mind occasional humor in moves, but we're aiming for serious rather than silly. In the comments speech is completely free; there you can joke as much as you like.\n\n**Note 2:** The story is presented completely in black and white! This means both character avatars, all textual descriptions from me, and all character descriptions and moves from you. The idea is that you use the colors white, black, and shades of gray, not red, blue, or brown, when you write. I hope that this helps use imagine how the story would look as a classic film noir.\n\n**Character creation**\n\nEach character must have the following in their description: name, and a Crime with a victim. Feel free to use the suggestions below or make up your own.\n\n**Name:** Your character's name.\n\nSuggested male names: *Joe Barcroft, Holly Bracken, Grant Mitchell, Walter Simmons, Hank Parker, Guy Brody, Harry Jones, Joe Hall, Jeff Corrigan, Leonard Edwards*\n\nSuggested female names: *Norma Robson, Vivian Garner, Phyllis Black, Lola Griffin, Kathie Morton, Iva Williams, Anne Percy, Lenora Lane, Carmen Zanette, Mona Smith*\n\n**Crime:** Each character is guilty of a crime not known by the authorities or the other characters. Describe the circumstances surrounding the crime and the victim.\n\nSuggested crimes: *Murder, Robbery, Blackmail, Arson, Theft, Kidnapping, Insurance Fraud, Drug dealing, Bribery, Procuring*\n\nSuggested victims: *Parent, Sibling, Own Child, Other Child, Spouse, Lover, Unknown Male, Unknown Female, Friend, Celebrity*", "name": "The Dead Don't Speak"}

For decades, the Kingdom has been at war with the Avalon Empire, their neighbor and seemingly eternal rival. Battles were fought across both Versaillia and Avalon, and as far away as their distant colonies in the New World.\n\nNow, after a decisive Versaillian victory in the battle of Alais, a treaty has been signed to bring an end to the long conflict. People across both lands rejoice at an end to the bloodshed. King Larvane XI, the beloved and respected ruler of Versaillia, has decreed that a grand feast will be held to celebrate the war's end.\n\nInvitations to the feast have been sent out to noteworthy figures across the realm. The invitations request that the recipients make their way to the Palace of Mirrors in the capital of Luetia at their earliest convenience. When a royal missive requests something 'at your earliest convenience', that generally means one should drop whatever they are doing and get there as soon as possible.\n\nPeace is a wonderful thing indeed, but it also opens up new opportunities. Will the feast be the simple celebration it appears to be? Or is it a golden opportunity for schemers and plotters to grab at power in the heart of the Kingdom?\n\nAlready, dark rumors swirl, threatening to sully the mood of good cheer. The people talk of disgruntled peasants threatening to revolt, protesting the high taxes brought by the war. Others claim that the victory was only secured by dark magical powers. Things often are not as they appear in the Palace of Mirrors.\n\nOOC Information:\n\nThis game is a bit of an experiment. The player characters will all rarely be working towards the same goals. This is a game of Machiavellian intrigue and plotting. You are strongly encouraged to let your subplot drive your character's actions. Plotting with your fellow players is certainly encouraged, but plotting against them is also encouraged. There will likely be some PvP aspects to this story.\n\nVersaillia, while oppressive in many regards, practices absolute primogeniture. The sexes are essentially equal. Please feel free to play a character of any gender in any role.\n\nThis is a low fantasy setting. Magic and fantastic creatures exist, but are exceedingly rare. Most people are uncertain about what is real and what is mere legend when it comes to the supernatural. Versaillia is loosely inspired by pre-revolutionary France, so assume a late 18th century level of technology.\n\nI will likely take 7-10 players depending on levels of interest and the sorts of applications I get. Feel free to create your own nature, strength, weakness, and subplot cards in addition to those provided. Please include an avatar image with your application.", "name": "The Royal Court"}
{"id": "83ee0a5b-dbf8-4f7d-9489-6d4b6317b4be", "premise": "You all know Penny.  She was a kid that lived up the street.  She rode her bicycle past your house every day as she came home from school.  Blonde pig-tails and a bright smile - she always waved and said 'hello'.\n\nThe night before an ambulance came, its rotating red lights drawing you from your perspective slumbers.  In robes and pajamas you stood on the sidewalk or your porches and watched as the girl was brought out on a stretcher with an oxygen mask held over her mouth and nose by a paramedic.\n\nPenny's Aunt and Uncle stood in the doorway of their house, watching as the vehicle swallowed Penny and drove away.  It wasn't normal - the way her guardians behaved.  They acted in no way like anything was out of the norm.  They shut the door, and in a moment the lights in the house were extinguished.\n\nYou considered following the ambulance to the hospital, but you hesitated.  As friendly as the girl seemed, the family was a strange lot.  It was more appropriate to return home and await news through the grapevine.\n\nWhen sleep resumed you had the most vivid dream.  You stood in a perfectly flat field with a rutted, dirt road stretching as far as you could see in either direction.  There were others along the road too.   One to the left, or perhaps one to the right.  They looked very familiar. \n\nBehind you a grove of trees marred an otherwise even coating of tall, yellow, flowering grass that waved in the breeze.  Something was creating a fuss in the grove, though you could not see what it was.\n\nIn the distance a wagon appeared, wobbling urgently along the packed, uneven trail.  As it neared you are astonished to see that its driver is a skunk.  In some respects it was a typical animal; it had black fur with a double white line from the top of its head to the tip of its tail.  But in most respects it was anything but typical; it was larger than any skunk you'd ever seen, it boasted a rounded belly, and it sat like a person holding the reigns of a mule in its paws.  It spoke when it came within distance. \n\n\"You look ridiculous,\" the skunk said loudly to ensure you heard him.  He raised an eyebrow and inspected you from the feet up with a not-so-polite gaze.\n\nInvoluntarily, you looked down at yourself.  At first, you believed your clothes had gotten larger, but then you realized, it was you who had gotten smaller.  You were a child - no older than eleven or twelve.\n\nThe skunk brought the wagon to a complete stop and asked very seriously, \"Have you seen a girl named Penelope?  It is of utmost importance that I find her.\"  The creature straightened his paisley patterned vest and adjusted a feathered hat in a way that was more habitual than necessary.\n\nBefore you could speak, assuming you were capable of answering, the source of the commotion in the trees was revealed.  A ragged crow flapped its wings wildly and ended a short flight by 'crash-landing' in the bed of the wagon.  After righting itself it said, \"Watch out for the...\"\n\nYou didn't catch the rest.  You awaken in your bed, rousted by the sound of a loudly cawing crow from outside your morning, sun-lit, bedroom window.\n\n*'That was odd'*, you might have thought to yourself as you went about your morning rituals of readying yourself for your drive to work.  You made your way to your car in the driveway, but before opening the door, your next door neighbor, who happened to be retrieving garbage cans from the curb, greeted you by mentioning a dream they had just experienced...\n\n\"...there was a talking skunk, and I was a kid.  There must have been onions on the pizza...\"\n\nAs if that was not bizarre enough, your neighbor  in the house to the other side overheard your first neighbor.  \"...I dreamed it too,\"  they said with widened eyes.\n\nThree neighbors having the same dream - did everyone on the street have it?\n\nIt raised the hair on the nape of your necks.\n\n.....\n\nIt is a small cast for this game - it will cap at three.\n\nI am approaching this differently than I have in my previous attempts.  The sub plots will play a greater role in the game as they will represent the 'you' in reality.  I will be playing a part in your chosen sub plots (likely not a good one) and those sub plots may evolve in ways that are out of your control (just like real life).\n\nBecause of this, I can't prepare some things until I know what the cast is going to be and what sub plots are in play.  I have created ten along with nature, strength, and weaknesses to choose from.  I will accept player created cards as long as they meet the spirit of the game.\n\nPlease write in past tense, with present tense dialog.  Display that in your character backgrounds too so I know you understand that.  I just don't care for the present tense posts - no other reason - it's just my preference.\n\nYou are regular people, in a regular neighborhood, with regular lives, facing issues that regular people face.  You could be single, married, have children, or you might even be a grand parent.  For a living you could be a stay-at-home parent, a salvage collector, a bank executive, a musician, to anything you can think of.\n\nSome of the story is known to me and I will build in that direction.  Most of it, however, is where it is taken by you.  One thing that *will* happen - it will get strange.  Perhaps not immediately, but the longer the story goes, I anticipate that the less control I will have and the more influence the cast will have.  I will do my very best to incorporate your creativity moving forward.\n\nYou can only move NPC's when you have strong control of a scene.  But - there will be some NPC's that you cannot control at anytime.  Those characters will be marked.\n\nThis is a normal paced game which means you should be posting 3 or 4 times a week.   At the risk of sounding like a jerk, I am sick of playing in games that are abandoned, thus I will *joyfully* write your death and replace you if you go quiet.  That grace period will be aggressively short.  I want to narrate one game and plan on playing in one, and only one.  I will not sacrifice my own enjoyment, or the active players', to accommodate 'non' participants.  That's as blunt as I can be.  Please don't join if you aren't going to pay ample attention to it.\n\nHow you build (or plan on building) and describe your character is the main consideration, but I also pay attention to how many games people are in.  If you are in a lot of them, then it's hard for me to imagine you will devote a fair amount of time to this one.  Perhaps you have that kind of time on your hands - I sure don't.  But maybe you do.  (I wish I did 8P).\n\nI appreciate you taking the time to look this over.  Please ask anything you want in the thread, I'll answer it at my first opportunity, but as previously mentioned - I am a busy lad and sometimes don't see things immediately.\n\nPeace!\n\n(PS:  Please post in the Looking For Players Thread if you haven't already in addition to submitting a character.  I'd like a chance to meet you...  in a posting kind of way).", "name": "Penelope and the Land of Dreams"}

This consists of teleporters set up on each new found world by the Finibus. \n\nThe Finibus: In order for a planet to be attached to the GTG, it must first be found, then a port must be placed and brought online, that is what these ships and their crews do. Their ships do have FTL travel but relativity does affect their existence, in other words; It may take the crew of a ship only a few months or a few years to find a new world but in that time 10, 100, even up to 300, years may have passed for people experiencing normal time in the GTG.\n\nOur Story\nStarts off in one of these Frontier Cities around a new world, the planet Gobi, it has been about one year since the station was constructed and terraforming is well underway, the crew of the COLD STAR is leaving for it\u2019s next exploration in a few months.

It's rather amazing.\n###For information on this Storium game, see the [Song of Engels Playguide](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lTLLjCVlXTlng1zy3LItSIUS9tGOiT8C7bJiF0NQQ7M).\n&nbsp;\n***\n&nbsp;\n#The war against the Migou rages on!\n\nIt is the year 2088, ten years after the start of the Aeon War with no end in sight.\n\nMankind is being pushed to its limits from every corner of the globe, fighting what endlessly seems like a losing battle to maintain what is theirs. Even with the introduction of the Engels to the armies of the NEG, that were our new hope for a future - every time we retake a piece of land, another is consumed by the Migou, the Rapine Storm, or the Order of Dagon... \n&nbsp;\n##A Land Girt By Sea... And Enemies\n\nThe Oceanic Combined Forces Command (OCFCOM) headquarters in Melbourne, Australia, is one of the largest south-most NEG military outposts left in the human-controlled world, standing proud and tall against the looming threat of the Migou. Back in the old world, Australians had a reputation for being 'laid back', sometimes lazy, and 'taking it on the chin'... now, they are some of the most resilient of fighters, holding the southern lines against those that would enslave us.\n\nMelbourne's defenses have been crippled, though. Considered one of the safer cities on the continent compared to the constant hell the likes of Darwin and Perth struggled against, they suffered a massive blow in late 2087 when their entire unit of Engels and half their mech force were wiped out in an botched attempt to reclaim Tasmania from the Migou; **Operation: Reclaim Borders**. Not only was this a massive loss of military units, but the Migou surged back against our borders in anger. Though fought off, the damage left to Melbourne is still being repaired, and they have lost one third of their military and civilian population.\n\nSeeing this weakness in Australia's forces, the Migou are pushing the boundaries along the southern coastline, while the Rapine Storm slowly begins to consume the Northern Territory and the top of Western Australia; furthermore there has been grim news of the Order of Dagon finally re-appearing on the great southern land, creeping along coastal settlements near Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef. The desert continent is being invaded from all corners. \n\nHelp is on the way, however. A new batch of Engels and mecha has been deployed with the latest upgrades and fast-tracked to Melbourne, while talented mech pilots have been hand-picked from the local military forces and begun the extensive and rigorous testing and training to become part of the most elite forces in the N.E.G. Army... the tamers of the beasts within metal, the otherworldly kindred...

Shielded by the mountains that ring the valley and fed by nutrient rich soil from glacial run-off, the valley was perfect for farming.\n\nNative American Indian legends surrounded Trumbull Valley since its discovery. Stories about beasts in its lakes and rivers, as well as spirits that roamed the valley and its forests were well-known by all in the region. The legends persist even in the modern day, as native locals speak of voices from the hills and the cries of long-dead ancestors.\n\nThe arrival of settlers heading west marked the beginning for Trumbull Valley's modern history. Farms were built in the center of the valley atop the fertile soil, and the towns of Marshall and Spencer's Mill were established in the southern and northern parts of the valley, respectively. Spencer's Mill in particular took advantage of the lush woodlands that cover the northern half of the valley, while Marshall became the metropolitan seat in Trumbull.\n\n**Character Creation Notes**\n\nPortraits are required. No picture, no entry. Characters are modern day, portraits should reflect that.\n\nTreat the Backstory as a writing sample. I need to evaluate what kind of writer you are to get a feel for what your moves will be like.\n\nCard Art is also required, it is intentionally not included. I'm evaluating what kinds of imagery you'll be using for Wild cards. Remember that I want a dark and violent game.\n\nIt's assumed that all the starting characters are good friends prior to the start of the game. I'll do my best to select a group of characters that are likely to be friends. Once we have our cast I'll help the players flesh out the relationships in the commentary section before the first scene.\n\nAdditional characters will be introduced in waves. Details below.\n\nI'm also *very* interested in players willing to have their character's die. If you want to work towards a death scene, please e-mail me and we'll work out the details.\n\n**Gameplay Notes**\n\nTense (Past, Present, or Future) and Perspective (First or Third Person) can be move dependent. I'm not concerned with keeping a cohesive narrative, just an interesting one.\n\nSpeed is set to Normal (2-3 Scenes\\week); the exception is I'm not active on weekends. I try to keep things at a steady pace, I will end scenes even if challenges aren't completed,  I will respond mid-scene to keep things moving, I will respond to challenges when they are completed, and I will wrap up scenes if everything has moved on in the narrative without everyone posting. I'm never going to wait on one or two at the expensive of the group. Players that go silent (No Moves, No Comments, No E-Mails) for a week will be written out of the game.\n\nCommunication is _very_ important to me. You don't have to move every day, but at least drop a note in the comments regularly so everyone knows what\u2019s going on. I understand that Real Life happens, but if I don't know that you're going to be away I don't know how to plan for your character.\n\n\"Zombie\" is a word I refrain from using in my undead survival games, I'd ask you to do the same.\n\nKnowledge of State of Decay is not necessary but if you\u2019re curious about locations or kinds of threats you'll be facing <http://stateofdecay.wikia.com> is a wonderful reference.\n\n**Upcoming Survivors**\n\nForests_of_Fire @ Wilkerson Farm\n\nPamphetamine @ Wilkerson Farm\n\nSpartain @ Wilkerson Farm\n\nJakeie @ Kirkman Residence\n\nTulip @ Kirkman Residence\n\nFables @ Kirkman Residence\n\nRohan @ McReady's Farmhouse\n\n**Further Questions**\n\nIf you have any other questions feel free to e-mail me Rob@BS-Radio.com", "name": "State of Decay: Trumbull Valley"}

The Houses, created as strongholds for the fallen Angellum after the Aura Wars, are constantly vying for dominance. Now only four of the oldest and most powerful Houses remain: Irydthion, Ya Mord\u00fcl, Kyle, and Halcyon Kept.\n\nThe war between Houses has taken a sudden, unexpected turn. Creatures unlike anything ever seen before have appeared, attacking all Houses without discretion, wielding technology equally as alien. Time is short on all sides. Each House begins to strenghten its military force in response to these new enemies. The race is on to discover the origins of these creatures, and all the while the tensions between Houses continue to mount until the breaking point becomes inevitable.\n\nNavigating through politcal struggles and internal deception, agents from each House discover that the strange creatures are only the newest development in a war so ancient and vast that it dwarfs their comprehension of time. Defeat of this new and deadly enemy is more than any House can handle on its own, and an alliance with the other Houses could be the deciding factor. But can an alliance between four powers with intermingled histories of prejudice and violence even be possible?", "name": "Halcyon Kept "}

The Rebellion is finding itself unable to properly manage the flood of new member planets from all across the galaxy, their meager parties stretched thin by piracy and fending off the sporadic attack from the remnants of the Empire slowly circling their strongholds. Troops and supplies are increasing at a breakneck speed, leaving the Rebellion without secure storage or training for the massive flood of resources hitting them. The push to overthrow Imperial fortresses has been less successful than originally thought, stemming mostly from the lack of adequate troops and ships, the Battle of Endor ambush destroying many important Rebellion fighters and ships.\n\nThe Empire, having lost 10% of its troops in a single military blunder, are in a political, economic and military bind. The massive propaganda blow of losing yet another superweapon has caused many planets to move to throw off the yoke of the Empire, drawing down heavy bombardment from the remaining Star Destroyers, destroying even more precious resources badly needed to rebuild. Outer Rim ore barons, aggravated at the loss of capital and potential work on the second Death Star have gathered many allies to push back and reclaim Imperial outposts in the area with minimal casualties. Coruscant has descended into complete political anarchy, with Rebels and Imperials jockeying for power, sometimes leading to outright war in the streets of the former capital of the Republic.\n\nIt has never been a better time to dance between the shadows of the wreckage of the Empire and the slowly growing light of the Rebellion. The Hutts have put forth massive bounties on both sides of the wars, looking to extract payment for damages dealt either by Luke Skywalker engineering the death of their favored son Jabba or the trillions of credits owed by the Empire for contracting and resource gathering.
